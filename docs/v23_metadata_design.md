# v2.3 — Dual-source-of-truth metadata + Series Manager

Design doc for the v2.3 line. Captures decisions made in conversation
with Mark on 2026-05-06 so future sessions (and future Mark) have the
canonical spec to work against.

This is a living doc. Update it as decisions change during
implementation; don't let the doc drift from reality.

## Goals

1. **Calibre/ABS metadata is no longer overwritten by Seshat
   enrichment.** Sync flows pull into a snapshot table; the editable
   Seshat view drifts independently.
2. **Diffs between sources are surfaced for review**, not silently
   resolved. Replaces the existing Suggestions page with a unified
   Metadata Manager.
3. **Genuinely shared series (Halo, Star Wars, etc.) are
   first-class.** The v2.2.7 author-scope fix correctly prevented the
   Cressman/Savarovsky merge but fragmented real shared series. v2.3
   needs both behaviors.
4. **Optional push-back** so Seshat can write user-edited metadata
   back to Calibre/ABS where the platform supports it.

## Non-goals

- Real-time bidirectional sync. Push-back is an explicit user action,
  not automatic.
- Replacing Calibre or ABS as the underlying library. Both stay
  authoritative for files, ownership, and reading state.
- Multi-user metadata workflows. Single-admin model unchanged.

## Data model

### `books_calibre_snapshot`

Frozen snapshot of every Calibre-sourced field per book, refreshed on
each Calibre sync. Read-only from the user's perspective.

    CREATE TABLE books_calibre_snapshot (
        book_id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        title          TEXT,
        authors_json   TEXT,    -- JSON array of {id, name, sort}
        series_name    TEXT,
        series_index   REAL,
        isbn           TEXT,
        cover_path     TEXT,    -- absolute path inside container
        description    TEXT,
        tags           TEXT,    -- comma-separated, mirrors Calibre
        rating         INTEGER, -- 0-10 in Calibre's scale
        language       TEXT,
        publisher      TEXT,
        formats        TEXT,    -- comma-separated extension list
        pubdate        TEXT,
        synced_at      REAL NOT NULL
    );

We store author/series as denormalized text (not FK to authors/series
in our schema) because the snapshot is meant to be a faithful
reproduction of Calibre's view, independent of how Seshat resolves
author/series identity.

### `books_abs_snapshot`

Same shape, ABS-specific fields included.

    CREATE TABLE books_abs_snapshot (
        book_id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        title          TEXT,
        authors_json   TEXT,
        series_name    TEXT,
        series_index   REAL,
        narrator       TEXT,
        duration_sec   INTEGER,
        abridged       INTEGER, -- 0/1
        asin           TEXT,
        description    TEXT,
        tags           TEXT,
        cover_path     TEXT,    -- not always populated (covers via API)
        language       TEXT,
        publisher      TEXT,
        audio_formats  TEXT,
        pubdate        TEXT,
        synced_at      REAL NOT NULL
    );

### `books` (Seshat-live, existing table)

No structural change to existing columns. Add:

    ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN metadata_source_pref TEXT
        NOT NULL DEFAULT 'seshat';
        -- 'seshat' | 'calibre' | 'abs' | 'mixed'
        -- 'mixed' uses field_source_map below

    ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN field_source_map TEXT;
        -- JSON: {"title": "calibre", "description": "seshat", ...}
        -- Only populated when metadata_source_pref = 'mixed'.

    ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN user_edited_fields TEXT;
        -- JSON array of field names the user has manually edited.
        -- Used to decide which fields auto-flow on sync diff and
        -- which queue for review.

### `series.author_id` becomes nullable

    -- conceptual; SQLite needs ALTER TABLE workaround
    -- (rename table → recreate with new schema → copy → drop)

    series.author_id INTEGER NULL  -- NULL = shared series

`UNIQUE(name, author_id)` is preserved (NULL is treated as distinct
in SQLite's UNIQUE semantics, so multiple shared series with the
same name CAN exist — that's a bug we'd need to guard against in
the upsert path; treat `name + NULL` as a single "shared row" key).

### `metadata_review_queue`

Replaces the existing Suggestions table conceptually. Single queue
for all metadata diffs awaiting user review.

    CREATE TABLE metadata_review_queue (
        id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        book_id      INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        field        TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'title', 'description', etc.
        old_value    TEXT,                 -- current Seshat-live value
        new_value    TEXT,                 -- proposed value
        source       TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'calibre' | 'abs' | 'goodreads' | 'hardcover' | ...
        proposed_at  REAL NOT NULL,
        UNIQUE(book_id, field, source)     -- new scan from same source replaces prior proposal
    );

## Sync semantics

### Calibre / ABS sync (pull side)

Per book in metadata.db (or ABS API):

1. Write into the corresponding snapshot table (full overwrite).
2. For each field, compute diff vs Seshat-live.
3. **If the book is brand new** (no `books` row yet): INSERT the
   `books` row with all fields populated from snapshot. No review
   queue entries. Mark `user_edited_fields=[]`.
4. **If the book exists** (Seshat-live row already there):
   - For each field where snapshot's new value differs from
     Seshat-live:
     - If `field` is NOT in `user_edited_fields` → auto-flow:
       update Seshat-live's column directly.
     - If `field` IS in `user_edited_fields` → enqueue
       `metadata_review_queue` row.
5. Commit.

### Source-scan writes (Goodreads, Hardcover, ABDB, etc.)

Per book per source:

1. For each field the source returns:
   - If Seshat-live's column is NULL/empty → write through directly.
     This is the "first discovery" case; no review noise.
   - If Seshat-live's column has a value AND new value differs →
     enqueue `metadata_review_queue` row with `source` = the
     scanning source. Do NOT touch Seshat-live.

The empty-field-wins-immediately rule means a brand-new book
discovered via Goodreads gets fully populated on first scan, and
subsequent scans (or scans from other sources) only generate review
items for genuine differences.

### Push-back (Seshat → Calibre/ABS)

Triggered by explicit user action ("Push to Calibre" / "Push to
ABS" buttons in the compare view). Never automatic.

**ABS** (always available, all images):
- `PATCH /api/items/{id}/media` with the changed fields.
- After successful PATCH, update `books_abs_snapshot` from the
  response so Seshat-live and snapshot match again.

**Calibre, full image** (with calibredb installed):
- `calibredb set_metadata <id> --field title:"..." --field ...` for
  scalar fields, `--field cover:/path/to/cover.jpg` for cover.
- After success, re-read metadata.db for that book ID and update
  `books_calibre_snapshot`.

**Calibre, slim image** (no calibredb): RESEARCH NEEDED.
- Option α: CWA exposes a metadata-edit API. Need to inspect
  `crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated` for the endpoint surface.
  If the underlying Calibre Web `/admin/book/edit/<id>` form POST
  is available, we can drive it (CSRF token + form fields).
- Option β: direct write to metadata.db + per-book metadata.opf +
  cover.jpg. Risky — getting the file/DB triplet out of sync leaves
  Calibre UI showing stale data. Effectively rewrites calibredb's
  job.
- Option γ: not viable — slim image deliberately omits Calibre.
- **Decision deferred to v2.3.2 implementation.** If neither α nor
  β is acceptable, slim users do not get Calibre push-back; that's
  a missing-feature, not a regression.

## Series Manager

### Auto-detect shared series during Calibre sync

In `calibre_sync.py` Pass 2, before the existing per-book series
upsert loop, build a map:

    calibre_series_id → set(seshat_author_id)

For each Calibre series ID:
- If the set has 1 member → upsert as `(name, author_id=that_one)`,
  current behavior.
- If the set has 2+ members → upsert as `(name, author_id=NULL)`
  (shared row). All books linked to it regardless of primary author.

This reproduces Halo's behavior (auto-shared) without re-merging
Cressman/Savarovsky (their Calibre series IDs are distinct).

### Series Manager page

Frontend page listing all series across the active library. Per row:

- Series name
- Authors involved (count + names if 2+)
- Book count
- Shared/per-author indicator

Actions:

- **Promote to shared**: select 2+ per-author rows with the same
  name → merge into one shared row. Books re-linked, old rows
  deleted.
- **Demote to per-author**: take a shared row → split into one row
  per contributing author. Books re-linked by their primary author.
- **Edit membership**: add/remove specific books from a series. (UI
  affordance for moving books between series, not just relabeling.)

For users without Calibre as a source-of-truth (or for
source-discovered books), the Series Manager is the only way to
mark a series as shared. For Calibre-backed libraries, auto-detect
covers the common case; Series Manager handles edge cases.

## UI surfaces

### Book sidebar (existing, modified)

Default display: Seshat-live values.

New: **Compare** button next to the sidebar header. Opens a panel
showing:
- Per-field columns: Seshat | Calibre snapshot | ABS snapshot.
- Differences highlighted.
- Per-field "← pull from Calibre" / "← pull from ABS" buttons that
  copy that field from snapshot to Seshat-live.
- "Push to Calibre" / "Push to ABS" buttons for fields the user
  changed locally (v2.3.2 only).

Per-field source toggle: deferred. Mark wants it; we'll evaluate
after the Compare panel ships whether per-field toggle is still
needed or whether per-field pull is enough.

### Metadata Manager page (new)

Replaces Suggestions. Three-panel layout:

- **Calibre diffs**: review_queue rows where source='calibre'.
- **ABS diffs**: source='abs'.
- **Source-scan diffs**: source IN ('goodreads', 'hardcover', ...).

Each row: book title, field, current vs proposed value, accept/reject
buttons. Bulk accept/reject across selected rows.

Settings page gets new toggles: "auto-accept Calibre diffs for these
fields" (cover, description, tags, rating) — but the default is
"all queue for review" since that's safer on first use.

### Series Manager page (new)

See above.

## Migration

One-time at first boot post-v2.3.0:

1. Snapshot tables created via standard MIGRATIONS list.
2. Backfill `books_calibre_snapshot` from current `books` rows where
   `source='calibre'`. Sets `synced_at=NOW()`.
3. Backfill `books_abs_snapshot` from current ABS-sourced books.
4. `metadata_source_pref` defaults to `'seshat'` for all books.
5. `user_edited_fields` defaults to `'[]'` (empty array).
6. `series.author_id` nullability migration: standard SQLite
   table-rename trick.
7. Existing Suggestions table is read on first boot, contents
   imported into `metadata_review_queue` with source='goodreads'
   (or whatever the original source was). Old table dropped after
   import.

The backfill assumes the current `books` columns ARE accurate
representations of what Calibre/ABS last said. That's almost true,
modulo any source-scan overwrites. Acceptable trade-off — the next
real Calibre/ABS sync corrects the snapshot.

## Phasing

**v2.3.0** — data model + Calibre/ABS dual-storage + Series Manager
(~1.5-2 weeks):
- Schema migrations (snapshot tables, nullable series.author_id,
  source pref, user_edited_fields, review queue).
- One-time backfill.
- Calibre/ABS sync rewrite to write to snapshots.
- Auto-flow vs queue-for-review logic per (3) above.
- Auto-detect shared series in Calibre sync.
- Series Manager page (browse + promote/demote + membership edit).
- No book sidebar UI changes yet — Seshat-live displayed everywhere
  as today.

**Source-scan rule (deferred to v2.3.4)**: rewriting `_merge_result`
to "write-through-on-empty + queue-on-populated" without the UI to
review queued items would accumulate unread queue rows that the user
can't act on. The owned-Calibre branch already implements the spirit
(per-field COALESCE-fill rules preserve user data), and the unowned
branch's full-overwrite has no curated data to protect. Net effect:
shipping the rule without the UI is risk without reward. v2.3.4
lands both together — see the v2.3.4 phasing section below for the
"Source-scan write rule rewrite" line item, which is exactly this
`_merge_result` change.

**v2.3.1 (shipped 2026-05-06)** — fast-follow patch from v2.2.14
UAT, before the larger UI work:
- ntfy `Title` header unicode crash fix (em-dash + smart quotes etc.
  folded to ASCII; bodies still UTF-8).
- Goodreads source-scan multi-retry loop with progress-stall
  detection. Eric Vall canary went from 174/359 (single retry) to
  expected near-completion.
- `PER_AUTHOR_BUDGET_SEC` 15min → 25min for prolific-author headroom.

The originally-planned v2.3.1 (Metadata Manager UI + per-field pull)
moved to v2.3.2 to keep the patch release small and shippable.

**v2.3.2 (shipped 2026-05-06)** — Scan quality + source URL editor:

The "scan-quality" release. Improves the per-source URL backfill
behavior and gives the user a friendly way to manage source URLs
per book. The Series Manager UX rebuild was originally planned to
ship here too but moved to v2.3.3 — the scan-quality work is a
coherent shippable unit on its own and the Series rebuild benefits
from independent UAT.

**Mandatory-source detail-fetch logic (the "Quarks and Qi" fix).**
Today the per-author `existing_titles` set fast-paths every source
on every known book — including sources that have no URL for that
book. So a book that already has a Kobo URL but no Goodreads URL
gets fast-pathed by Goodreads, which silently never tries again.

The fix: per-source-per-book gating, controlled by a new "Mandatory"
flag in `metadata_sources` settings.

- Compute two sets per author scan:
  - `per_source_existing_titles`: titles each source has URL'd
    already (parse `books.source_url` JSON per row).
  - `books_with_any_url`: titles with at least one URL from any
    enabled source.
- For each source, pass `existing_titles` as:
  - **Mandatory source** → `per_source_existing_titles[source]`.
    Fast-path only on books THIS source has URL'd. Books missing
    this source's URL still get a DETAIL fetch every scan.
  - **Non-mandatory source** → `books_with_any_url`. Fast-path on
    any book with at least one URL anywhere — preserves today's
    behavior for supplementary sources (Google Books, IBDB, Amazon).
- Default `mandatory: true` for the existing primary tier
  (Goodreads, Hardcover for ebook; Audible, Hardcover for audiobook).
  All others default `false`.
- Settings UI: new "Mandatory" checkbox column on the Metadata
  Sources panel with a tooltip explaining the trade-off.

Bounds the worst-case scan cost: mandatory_count × books rather
than total_sources × books. End state is stable — once mandatory
sources have URLs for a book, behavior settles back to today's
fast-path-everywhere.

**Source URL editor in book sidebar.** Currently editing source URLs
requires hand-writing the `{"goodreads": "...", "hardcover": "..."}`
JSON. New friendlier UX:

- One labeled input per source the book already has, with an "X"
  remove button to drop that source's URL entirely.
- One always-empty input at the bottom with a "+" button. User
  pastes any source URL → Seshat parses it, identifies the source,
  canonicalizes the URL (e.g. strips Goodreads's title slug, keeps
  only `/book/show/<id>`), and adds it to the appropriate slot.
- Backend helper: each source class gets a `parse_url(url) -> str |
  None` method that returns the canonical URL if it matches that
  source, None otherwise. UI calls each enabled source until one
  matches, then writes back to `books.source_url`.
- Per-source canonicalization rules:
  - Goodreads: `https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/<id>(-slug)?` →
    `https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/<id>`.
  - Hardcover: `https://hardcover.app/books/<slug>` → unchanged.
  - Kobo: country-domain variants → canonical `kobo.com` form.
  - Amazon: any format → strip to `amazon.com/dp/<ASIN>`.
  - Audible: strip to `audible.com/pd/<asin>`.
  - IBDB / Google Books: keep as-is (their URL shapes are already
    canonical).

**Scan-mode taxonomy** — codified contract for how each scan
entry point treats existing data. v2.3.2 verified that all entry
points behave per this table:

| Entry point | Scope | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Command Center "Source Scan" | All authors | Incremental — URL-backfill on books that already have non-mandatory URLs; DETAIL fetch on books missing a mandatory source's URL; full DETAIL on any book with 0 URLs. Discover any new books on each author's source pages. |
| Author detail "Re-sync" | One author | Same shape as Command Center, scoped to one author. |
| Author detail "Full Scan" | One author | **Full re-fetch.** Every book (owned, missing, hidden) gets a fresh DETAIL fetch on every enabled source. Mandatory flag ignored — everything is full-detail. Updates source URLs and re-merges all metadata. |
| Author page multi-select "Scan Sources" / "Scan Audio" | Selected authors | Same shape as Command Center, scoped to the selected authors. |
| Command Center "Full Re-scan" (v2.3.2 addendum) | All authors | `run_full_rescan` — same shape as Author "Full Scan", but spans every author. Used rarely; primarily for post-disaster recovery or schema-bump backfills. |

A library with completely cleared source data is a degenerate case:
every book has 0 URLs, so the incremental modes naturally do
full-DETAIL on every book — effectively a full scan without needing
to be invoked as one. No special-casing required.

In v2.3.4+, the same scan-mode shapes apply but writes route
through the dual-storage flow (Seshat-live + queue diffs for review)
instead of the current direct-write to `books`.

**v2.3.3 (shipped 2026-05-07)** — Series Manager UX rebuild:

The user-facing model on the Series Manager page is now "this series
has these authors" — promote/demote verbs no longer surface in the
UI. Authority (per-author vs shared) auto-flips server-side based on
the resulting distinct-author count.

- Backend (`app/discovery/routers/series.py`):
  - `_recompute_series_author(db, sids)` helper — single source of
    truth for the auto-flip rule. 1 distinct author → per-author;
    2+ → NULL (shared); 0 books → no-op. Catches the
    UNIQUE(name, author_id) collision on the rare shared→per-author
    case (existing per-author row of the same name) and degrades
    gracefully with a logger.warning.
  - New `GET /series/{sid}/authors` — distinct authors for a series
    with per-author book counts; drives the modal's left panel.
  - New `POST /series/{sid}/authors` `{author_id, book_ids}` —
    captures source series IDs **before** the move and recomputes
    authority on `{dest} ∪ sources` so cross-series book moves flip
    the source series back to per-author when the move was their
    last book by a contributing author.
  - New `DELETE /series/{sid}/authors/{author_id}` — detaches every
    book by that author from the series; recomputes authority on
    the series afterward.
  - Existing `POST /series/{sid}/books` and
    `DELETE /series/{sid}/books/{book_id}` were wired to the same
    helper so authority stays consistent regardless of which
    endpoint mutates membership.
  - Existing `/series/promote` and `/series/{sid}/demote` stay as
    low-level escape hatches + auto-detect path callers; the
    docstring marks them as no-longer-user-facing.

- List endpoint (`GET /series`) gained:
  - `cover_book_id` per row (most cover-worthy book in the series:
    prefers books with cover_path/cover_url/audiobookshelf_id, then
    series_index, then pub_date). Frontend hits
    `/api/discovery/covers/{cover_book_id}` directly.
  - Pagination: `limit` (1-200, default 50) + `offset`. Response
    shape gained `total`, `limit`, `offset` alongside the existing
    `series` array.
  - Search now matches series name OR author name OR **book title**.
    Book-title match goes through a `s.id IN (SELECT series_id FROM
    books WHERE title LIKE ?)` subquery to keep per-series counts
    correct (a row-level `b.title LIKE` would have shrunk `book_count`
    to only the matching books — regression test guards against this).

- Frontend:
  - `ManageMembersModal.tsx` (new component): two-section modal —
    current authors with per-row Remove + bottom "Add author" flow
    (debounced author autocomplete → book picker filtered to that
    author's full library, including books already on other series
    so a single click moves them. Books currently on the destination
    series show as disabled "already on this series").
  - `DiscSeriesPage.tsx` rewritten: dropped checkbox column + bulk
    Promote button. Added 72×108 cover thumbnail per row, larger row
    height (~12px vertical padding), debounced search, per-row
    "Manage members" button, and prev/next pagination at the bottom
    when total > 50. Search hint updated to mention book titles.

- Tests: 28 new tests across `test_series_authors.py` (18) +
  `test_series_manager.py` (10 covering pagination + book-title
  search + cover_book_id). Suite total: 1460 passing (was 1432
  on v2.3.2).

**v2.3.4.1 → v2.3.4.5 (all shipped 2026-05-07)** — five fast-follow
patches on top of v2.3.4. UAT passed end-to-end:

- **v2.3.4.1** — Calibre WAL-aware mtime + ABS lastUpdate+itemCount
  composite. Scheduled syncs now catch CWA WAL writes (max-mtime
  across `.db`/`.db-wal`/`.db-shm`) and ABS item-count changes
  (composite `f"{lastUpdate}:{numItems}"` survives ABS not bumping
  lastUpdate on item adds).
- **v2.3.4.2** — sidebar 500 fix (inner `current_row` shadowed the
  outer one used by user_edited_fields merge → IndexError on
  every save). Series Manager hides empty/all-hidden series by
  default with `?include_empty=true` opt-in.
- **v2.3.4.3** — bulk-action toast grammar ("Hidden"/"Dismissed"/
  "Deleted" replacing "Hided"/"Dismissd"). Hidden page gains
  All/Owned only/Discovered only filter tabs.
- **v2.3.4.4** — multi-library slug routing across every per-book
  mutation. Backstory: cross-library id-collision data corruption
  (Mark edited an audiobook MAM URL, write landed on the same-id
  Calibre row). Dual-storage saved Calibre proper. Frontend
  `slugQuery()` helper + BookActionHandler optional slug arg
  threaded through 8 onAction implementations + bulk-* paths +
  source-url editor + Compare/pull. Diff comparison is now type-
  aware (no more `"1.0"` vs `1.0` false flags). Compare panel
  surfaces a synthetic "Series" row (resolved via JOIN to
  series.name, snapshot.series_name); pull series_name resolves
  snapshot name → find-or-create author-scoped series →
  series_id. Toasts on Edit Saved + Compare pull. See
  `feedback_seshat_multi_library_slug.md` for the class-of-bug
  pattern future endpoints must avoid.
- **v2.3.4.5** — CI fix: docker-publish workflow used `type=semver`
  which rejects 4-segment tags. v2.3.4.1/2/3/4 tag-push runs were
  silently failing while branch-push runs kept emitting
  `:latest-slim`. Switched to `type=match,pattern=v(\d+\.\d+\.\d+
  (?:\.\d+)?),group=1` so 3-segment AND 4-segment tags both work.
  Retroactively first publish that emitted `:2.3.4.5` /
  `:2.3.4.5-slim` / `:2.3` / `:2.3-slim` to GHCR.

---

**v2.3.4 (shipped 2026-05-07)** — Metadata Manager UI + dual-
storage UI + source-scan write rule + hidden-book correctness:

- **Compare panel** in book sidebar — per-field side-by-side Seshat
  vs Calibre snapshot vs ABS snapshot, with per-field "← pull from
  Calibre" / "← pull from ABS" actions.
- **Metadata Manager page** replacing the existing Suggestions page
  AND the conceptual "Suggestions" review-queue from the design.
  Tabbed layout — Calibre diffs, ABS diffs, source-scan field diffs,
  and a "Series moves" tab folding in the existing
  `series-suggestions` source-consensus auto-flow (so non-Calibre
  source-discovered "this book belongs to series X #3" suggestions
  still have a home). Bulk accept/reject across selected rows. The
  old `DiscSuggestionsPage.tsx` retires; `series-suggestions` table
  + endpoints stay (Metadata Manager reads them via the new tab).
- **Per-field source toggle** (only if Compare panel doesn't cover
  the use case).
- **Sidebar edit UI populates `user_edited_fields`** when the user
  changes a field, otherwise auto-flow eats every edit on next sync.
- **Source-scan write rule rewrite**: write-through-on-empty +
  queue-on-populated for Goodreads/Hardcover/Kobo/IBDB. Lands
  alongside the UI so reviewer noise has somewhere to go.

- **Hidden-book Series Manager fixes (v2.3.3 fast-follow)**.
  v2.3.3 shipped two correctness gaps that surfaced during UAT:
  - `_recompute_series_author(db, sids)` and
    `GET /api/discovery/series/{sid}/authors` don't filter
    `hidden=0`, so hidden books contribute to the distinct-author
    count and surface in the Manage Members modal. A hidden Bob
    book on a per-author Alice series wrongly flips it to shared,
    and the modal lists Bob in "Current authors" with no way to
    interact (Remove would orphan the hidden book; the modal book
    picker correctly hides hidden books, so re-adding is a dead end).
    Fix: add `AND b.hidden = 0` to both queries.
  - Hide / unhide doesn't trigger `_recompute_series_author` on the
    affected book's series. So even after the filter fix above, the
    helper's pre-computed `series.author_id` goes stale on every
    hide/unhide. Fix: route the hide and unhide endpoints through a
    helper that recomputes authority on the affected series id
    after the toggle.

- **Hidden-book scan behavior** — incremental URL backfill, no DETAIL.
  Pre-v2.3.4 model (per v2.2.3 + lookup.py 2455/2649): hidden books
  are a true garbage bin in incremental mode — `_is_hidden` blocks
  every write. In `full_scan` mode they ride the URL-backfill fast
  path (no detail fetch). Mark's request: extend the full_scan
  behavior to incremental too. Hidden books should:
  - Stay in `existing_titles` for skip-already-found ✓ (already does).
  - Get URL-only writes from incremental scans when a source matches
    by canonical URL — boosts future scan efficiency by populating
    per-source URLs on the hidden row, so subsequent scans of an
    author with a giant catalog (John Walker — 1,069 books on
    Goodreads) can fast-path past the hidden ones via URL match
    instead of paying DETAIL on every unmatched title.
  - **Never** trigger DETAIL fetch — the existing v2.2.3 garbage-bin
    intent stands. Hidden = "I've seen it, ignore the metadata."
  Implementation: split the `_is_hidden` short-circuit into two
  decisions — "drop metadata writes" (always) vs "drop URL-only
  writes" (only when there's no URL to write). The full_scan branch
  already has the right shape; mirror into the incremental branch.

Total: original v2.3.4 scope + 3 hidden-book deliverables. Estimate
extends to ~2 weeks given the bundled scope.

**v2.3.5** — push-back (caps the v2.3 arc):
- ABS push-back via PATCH `/api/items/{id}/media`.
- Calibre push-back via `calibredb set_metadata` (full image only).
- CWA push-back via the upstream Calibre-Web `/admin/book/<id>` form
  POST (slim image; researched 2026-05-07 — see "CWA push-back
  feasibility" below).
- Bulk push/pull verbs ("Push all my edits to Calibre/ABS" / "Pull
  all upstream values for my edited fields").
- Pull endpoint flips to **pull-clears** semantics for symmetry with
  push-clears (see "user_edited_fields semantics" below).

**user_edited_fields semantics on push/pull (locked 2026-05-07).**
Both verbs *clear* the named field from `user_edited_fields` on
success. Mental model: "after push or pull, both DBs agree → that
value IS the truth, no edit divergence to flag." Future upstream
changes to a now-cleared field auto-flow on next sync (no review
queue). The user re-enters the "watched" state by editing the field
again in the sidebar — `PUT /books/{bid}` always re-adds to
`user_edited_fields` on diff-vs-stored, regardless of prior state.

This is a **behavior change** to v2.3.4's `/pull` endpoint, which
previously *added* to `user_edited_fields`. Migration: just flip
the merge to a remove. Documented in the v2.3.4 → v2.3.5 changelog
section of the README.

**CWA push-back feasibility (researched 2026-05-07).**
Verdict: **Option β (form POST)** ships. Option α (dedicated REST
API) does not exist as a separate surface in CWA — the only API-
shaped endpoints CWA inherits from Calibre-Web are KOReader sync
and OPDS. Option γ (direct metadata.db write) stays rejected.

Wire shape Seshat targets:

```
POST {CWA_BASE}/login
  form: username=...&password=...
  → captures `session` cookie

GET {CWA_BASE}/admin/book/<calibre_id>
  → scrapes `csrf_token` from <input name="csrf_token">

POST {CWA_BASE}/admin/book/<calibre_id>
  Cookie: session=...
  X-CSRFToken: <token>
  multipart/form-data:
    book_title, authors, comments (description as HTML),
    series, series_index, tags, publisher, languages,
    pubdate (YYYY-MM-DD; empty string is no-op, not clear),
    rating (0-10), cover_url, identifier-type-N/identifier-val-N,
    checkA=on/off (auto-author-sort), checkT=on/off (auto-title-sort)
```

Auth: cached session cookie + CSRF token in-memory for the request
lifetime; refresh on 401/400-CSRF failure. Token is HTML-scraped
(no header-served alternative). New encrypted-store secret
`cwa_password` + plaintext-settings `cwa_base_url` and
`cwa_username`. If unset on a slim image and Mark attempts a
Calibre push, the unified push endpoint returns 409 "configure
CWA in Settings → Sinks."

Field-coverage gotchas to honor:
- `pubdate` empty string is a no-op, not a clear. To clear, send
  a sentinel ABS API quirk doesn't have. Skip clearing pubdate
  on push for now (push only when value is truthy).
- Cover push: prefer `cover_url` field (CWA fetches via
  `helper.save_cover_from_url`) over multipart upload. Seshat
  has no per-host cover URL accessible from CWA's POV anyway —
  the cover is on disk in Calibre already; cover push requires
  more thought and is **deferred to v2.4.x** (out of v2.3.5
  scope). Implementation: skip cover_path in the push field map
  for CWA + calibredb both. Pull-from-Calibre is unaffected.
- Comments are HTML (Markup.unescape). Send descriptions as-is.
- Authors / tags are comma-separated strings, not arrays.
- `checkA=false` and `checkT=false` to prevent CWA from
  auto-rewriting author_sort and title_sort on push (we don't
  want CWA's heuristics to override Seshat's edits).

Risks:
1. CSRF token bootstrap is HTML-scrape-fragile. Mitigation: pin a
   known-good CWA version range in docs; smoke-test on bumps.
2. Internal endpoint stability — upstream Calibre-Web has
   rearranged these routes before. Same mitigation.
3. Per-push sidecar accumulates in
   `/app/calibre-web-automated/metadata_change_logs/`. Informational,
   not a blocker — flag in the README.

**Bulk verbs**:
- `POST /books/{bid}/push` body shape extended:
  `{"source": "calibre"|"abs", "fields": [...]}` is per-field;
  `{"source": ..., "all_user_edited": true}` is the bulk variant.
  Server iterates `user_edited_fields`, pushes each, clears each
  on success. Returns `{applied: [...], failed: [...]}`.
- `POST /books/{bid}/pull` mirrors the same `all_user_edited`
  flag. Iterates `user_edited_fields`, pulls each from snapshot,
  clears each on success.

**Pre-tag release checklist for v2.3.5 (caps the v2.3 arc):**
- [ ] Re-run the full backend test suite locally — should be green
      with no skips beyond the pre-existing optional-dep ones
      (`test_covers.py` respx, `test_sse.py` sse_starlette).
- [ ] Browser smoke test against Mark's live container.
- [ ] **Audit GitHub Security tab — CodeQL alerts.** Triage every
      open alert that surfaced during the v2.3 arc. Real findings
      get fixed in v2.3.5 (or a fast-follow). FPs get dismissed in
      the Security tab with reasoning that references SECURITY.md
      (mirror the v2.2.10 pattern). The v2.3 line touched a lot of
      new query construction in `series.py` (string-built SQL with
      `WHERE/HAVING` composition, `IN ({ph})` patterns) and new
      file-path / cover-path handling — pay attention to
      SQL-injection and path-traversal categories specifically.
- [ ] **Audit GitHub Dependabot alerts.** Bump any flagged
      dependency that's not pinned for compatibility reasons. If a
      bump is incompatible (rare), document the deferral in the
      Security tab dismissal.
- [ ] After tag push, watch GitHub Actions for the
      `:latest` + `:latest-slim` matrix build and confirm the
      `Build:` SHA in Settings footer updates after Mark's
      `docker pull`.

Total estimate: ~3-4 weeks from v2.3.3 onward, validated
incrementally.

## Open questions / decisions log

| Date | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-06 | Per-field vs per-book toggle granularity | Per-field |
| 2026-05-06 | "Calibre as source of truth" semantics | Option C (per-field pull, no per-book toggle) |
| 2026-05-06 | Source-scan write rule | Write-through if Seshat-live field empty; review-queue otherwise |
| 2026-05-06 | Calibre diff auto-flow rule | Auto-flow on fields where `user_edited_fields` doesn't include the field; review queue otherwise |
| 2026-05-06 | Push-back support | Yes, deferred to v2.3.2; ABS always supported, Calibre full-image yes via calibredb, slim image research-deferred |
| 2026-05-06 | Bundle Series Manager into v2.3 | Yes, in v2.3.0 |
| 2026-05-06 | Halo-style shared series detection | Auto-detect from Calibre's books_series_link multi-author signal during sync |
| 2026-05-06 | Source-scan rule timing | Originally targeted v2.3.1; now v2.3.2 alongside the Metadata Manager UI. Owned-book branch already preserves user data via per-field rules (COALESCE-fill / smart-description / oldest-pub_date); unowned branch has no curated data to protect. Shipping queue routing without the UI to review = noise without value. |
| 2026-05-06 | v2.3.1 scope (mid-line) | Patch release with ntfy unicode fix + Goodreads multi-retry loop + per-author budget bump, ahead of the larger v2.3.2 UI work. Original v2.3.1 plan (Compare panel + Metadata Manager) shifted to v2.3.2; original v2.3.2 (push-back) shifted to v2.3.3. |
| 2026-05-06 | Series Manager UX model | Replace "promote / demote" verbs with author-list membership. The mental model is "this series has these authors", driven by per-row "Manage members" → add/remove authors. Promote/demote happens automatically based on the resulting distinct-author count (1 → 2+ = shared; 2+ → 1 = per-author). Drop the multi-row checkbox + bulk-Promote button; rename + delete row actions stay. Cover preview from first book in the series for visual identity. |
| 2026-05-06 | Series author add/remove semantics | "Add author Y to series X" = assign at least one book by Y to series X (user-selected from a book list). "Remove author Y" = detach every book by Y from series X. The series's author list is implicit, computed from `SELECT DISTINCT author_id FROM books WHERE series_id = X` — no separate `series_authors` table needed. |
| 2026-05-06 | Per-source URL-backfill gating | Per-source-per-book gate, controlled by a `mandatory: bool` flag on each entry in `metadata_sources` settings. Mandatory sources fast-path only on books THIS source has URL'd; non-mandatory fast-path on any book with at least one URL anywhere. Default mandatory=true for primary tier (Goodreads/Hardcover for ebook; Audible/Hardcover for audiobook). Bounds worst-case scan cost to mandatory_count × books rather than total_sources × books. |
| 2026-05-06 | Source URL editor UX (book sidebar) | Replace free-text JSON edit with a labeled-input-per-source list + "X" remove buttons + a single "+" add field. Each source class gets a `parse_url()` method that canonicalizes pasted URLs (e.g. strip Goodreads slug, normalize Amazon to /dp/<ASIN>). UI tries each enabled source in priority order until one matches the pasted URL. |
| 2026-05-06 | Scan-mode taxonomy | Four entry points enumerated. Three are "incremental" (Command Center, Author detail Re-sync, Author multi-select Scan Sources/Audio) and behave identically modulo scope: URL-backfill on non-mandatory sources, DETAIL on mandatory-but-missing, full-DETAIL on books with 0 URLs. The fourth (Author detail Full Scan) ignores the mandatory flag and re-fetches everything. Cleared-source-data state degenerates naturally into full-DETAIL via the 0-URLs branch — no special handling. |
| 2026-05-06 | v2.3.2 vs v2.3.3 split | v2.3.2 = scan quality + source URL editor + Series UX rebuild (validated in isolation, no dual-storage UI yet). v2.3.3 = Compare panel + Metadata Manager UI + sidebar populates user_edited_fields + source-scan write rule. v2.3.4 = push-back. Smaller, more incrementally-validatable releases beat one big v2.3.2. |
| 2026-05-06 | v2.3.2 narrowed further; +1 slot for everything else | v2.3.2 ships scan-quality (mandatory-source detail-fetch + per-source `existing_titles` gating) + source URL editor + scan-mode taxonomy verification only. Series Manager UX rebuild moves from v2.3.2 to v2.3.3 (it's a UX-only release; benefits from independent UAT). Metadata Manager UI moves to v2.3.4. Push-back to v2.3.5. Each release is smaller and more focused; the scan-quality work is the most user-visible change so it ships first. |
| 2026-05-07 | Cross-series book moves auto-flip BOTH ends | When a book moves from series Y to series X via the new POST `/series/{sid}/authors` (or the existing book-level POST `/series/{sid}/books` after wiring), `_recompute_series_author` is called on `{X} ∪ {sources}` — the moved books' previous series_ids captured before the UPDATE. Without this, source series with 2 contributing authors that lose their only book by author B would stay flagged "shared" despite now having only A's books left. |
| 2026-05-07 | series_index cleared on author-level moves, preserved on book-level | POST `/series/{sid}/authors` clears `series_index` to NULL on the moved books (the index is series-scoped; carrying a #6 from the old series into a new one produces gibberish). The existing book-level POST `/series/{sid}/books` keeps its caller-controlled `indices` contract — that endpoint is used by code that knows what indices to set. |
| 2026-05-07 | UNIQUE(name, author_id) collision on shared→per-author flip | If a series flipping from shared to per-author would collide with an existing per-author row of the same name, `_recompute_series_author` catches the IntegrityError, leaves authority as NULL, and logs a warning. The membership change still lands. User can manually resolve via rename or delete. Pragmatic over auto-merging (which would be destructive without consent). |
| 2026-05-07 | Cover-pick ordering for series rows | Per-series cover_book_id picks: books with any cover signal (cover_path / cover_url / audiobookshelf_id) first, then series_index ASC NULLS-LAST (via COALESCE 9999), then pub_date ASC, then id ASC. Correlated subquery — fine at our scale (hundreds of series). Hidden books excluded so the list doesn't surface a cover the user explicitly pruned. |
| 2026-05-07 | Book-title search via subquery, not row-level WHERE | A row-level `b.title LIKE ?` would shrink the GROUP BY's `book_count` to only matching books (e.g. searching "Reach" on a 5-book Halo would report book_count=1). Implemented as `s.id IN (SELECT series_id FROM books WHERE title LIKE ?)` so per-series aggregations stay correct. Regression-tested. |
| 2026-05-07 | v2.3.5 push-back: `user_edited_fields` cleared on push AND pull | After either verb, both DBs agree on that field — there's no "edit divergence" to flag, so the entry is removed from `user_edited_fields`. Future upstream changes auto-flow on next sync. User re-enters watched state by editing the field again (PUT diff-tracks against stored row). Symmetric pull-clears is a behavior change from v2.3.4's pull-adds — flagged in the v2.3.4 → v2.3.5 changelog. |
| 2026-05-07 | v2.3.5 CWA push: form POST, not REST API | CWA does not ship a REST metadata API. The viable surface is the upstream Calibre-Web `/admin/book/<id>` form POST handler. Auth = login form → session cookie → CSRF token scraped from a rendered page → multipart POST. Encrypted-store secret `cwa_password` + plaintext `cwa_base_url` / `cwa_username`. CSRF token is HTML-scraped (no header alternative) — fragile across CWA version bumps; mitigation is a pinned-version smoke test. |
| 2026-05-07 | Cover push deferred to v2.4.x | CWA's `cover_url` field expects a fetchable URL; calibredb's `--field cover:/path` expects a local file. Plumbing a Seshat-served cover URL or routing to a temp file is more design work than v2.3.5 should carry. v2.3.5 push field map omits `cover_path`. Pull-cover-from-Calibre/ABS unaffected (pull is a local snapshot copy). |
| 2026-05-07 | v2.3.5 bulk verbs ("push all my edits", "pull all my edits") | `POST /books/{bid}/push` and `POST /books/{bid}/pull` accept either `{fields: [...]}` (per-field) or `{all_user_edited: true}` (bulk over the current `user_edited_fields` array). Returns `{applied: [...], failed: [...]}` so partial-success is observable. UI surfaces as two extra buttons in the Compare modal header. |

Update this table as decisions evolve during implementation.
