"""
MAM user-status API.

`get_user_status()` hits MAM's `jsonLoad.php` endpoint, which returns
the authenticated user's current ratio, wedge count, class name,
seedbonus, and upload/download totals. The policy engine uses these
values to make per-announce decisions:

  - ratio → should we spend download credit on this torrent?
  - wedges → can we apply a freeleech wedge to avoid ratio cost?
  - classname → does "VIP" appear in the class name (affects some
    site-level perks, though the per-torrent VIP flag is separate)?
  - seedbonus → how many bonus points are available to buy more wedges?

The response is cached in-memory for a configurable TTL (default 5
minutes) so that a burst of announces doesn't hammer MAM with
redundant user-status lookups.

Routes through `cookie._do_get` so cookie auto-rotation fires on
every response.
