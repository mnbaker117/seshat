"""
MAM economy decision engine.

Pure decision functions — no I/O, no database, no HTTP. Given a
`UserStatus` snapshot, a config object, and the last-buy timestamp,
each `decide_*` call returns an `EconomyDecision` that the scheduler
or router can act on (or audit as a skip).

The split mirrors `app/policy/engine.py`: all orchestration (cookie
resolution, scheduling, HTTP calls, audit writes) lives one layer up.
This module only encodes the rules.

Outcome codes on the returned `EconomyDecision.reason` are the same
strings the `economy_audit` table stores — there's exactly one column
for this field, so the scheduler can stamp it directly without a
translation layer.

    disabled               — feature flag is off
    below_interval         — less time elapsed since last buy than the
                             configured interval
    no_trigger             — upload: none of ratio/buffer/bonus fired
    insufficient_bonus     — a trigger fired but the user can't afford
                             the computed amount
    trigger:interval       — VIP: the interval elapsed; buy the
                             configured weeks
    trigger:ratio          — upload: ratio dropped below floor
    trigger:buffer         — upload: buffer dropped below floor
    trigger:bonus          — upload: seedbonus exceeded ceiling; spend
                             the excess on buffer

For the bonus trigger, the spend amount is computed here:
`(seedbonus − bonus_ceiling) / BP_PER_UPLOAD_GB`. That exact
formulation guarantees the post-buy seedbonus lands at the ceiling
when MAM charges linearly, which is the whole point of the knob
("I want to keep at most N BP reserved"). Every other mode uses a
fixed `*_chunk_gb` value from config.
