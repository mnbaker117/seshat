"""
Shared mutable state for Seshat's background tasks.

Module-level singletons that the lifespan startup, the routers, and the
background workers all read and mutate. Because Python modules are
singletons within a process, every importer sees the same values.

IMPORTANT — module attribute access:
    Always use `state.foo`, not `from app.state import foo`. Direct
    imports create a local binding that won't see updates from other
    modules. For REASSIGNMENT, you MUST use the module attribute form
    (`state.foo = new_value`) — bare assignment inside a function
    rebinds a local variable instead of mutating the shared state.
