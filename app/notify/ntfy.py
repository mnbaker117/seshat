"""
ntfy.sh notification sender.

`send()` posts a notification to the configured ntfy topic. Used for:
  - Grab events (new book grabbed)
  - Download completion
  - Pipeline errors (Calibre rejection, staging failure)
  - Daily digest summaries

ntfy.sh is a simple HTTP-based pub/sub notification service. Sending a
notification is just an HTTP POST with the message body as plain text
and metadata in headers. No authentication is required for public
topics; self-hosted ntfy servers may need auth (not yet supported —
add when a user needs it).

The module is a no-op when `ntfy_url` is empty in settings, so callers
don't need to guard against "notifications not configured".
