"""
Snatch ledger — tracks every torrent that's currently counting against
the MAM snatch budget.

Lifecycle of a ledger row:

  1. **`record_grab(grab_id, qbit_hash)`** — called by the orchestration
     layer right after a successful submission to qBittorrent.
     Inserts a row with `seeding_seconds=0`, `released_at=NULL`.
  2. **`update_seeding(qbit_hash, seeding_seconds)`** — called
     periodically by the budget watcher with fresh data from qBit's
     `/api/v2/torrents/info` response. Updates the row's seedtime
     and timestamps the check.
  3. **`mark_released(grab_id, reason)`** — flips `released_at` to
     now. Called either when a row hits the seed-time threshold
     (reason `"seedtime_reached"`) or when the torrent is no longer
     present in qBit (reason `"removed_from_qbit"`).

The "currently in budget" count is `count(* WHERE released_at IS NULL)` —
that's the number the queue manager and the dashboard read.

Every function in this module takes an `aiosqlite.Connection` parameter
explicitly. We don't open or close connections here — that's the
caller's responsibility, partly because the `init_db()` flow opens its
own connection and partly because the test fixture wants to verify
state across multiple operations on the same connection.
