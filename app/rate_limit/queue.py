"""
Pending grabs queue.

When the snatch budget is full and queue mode is enabled, an incoming
announce gets fetched (so we have the .torrent bytes locally) and
parked in `pending_queue` instead of being submitted to qBittorrent.
A budget watcher pops the highest-priority pending grab whenever a
`snatch_ledger` row releases.

The queue is FIFO by default — older queued grabs win — but every
row also has a `priority` integer column that overrides FIFO when
non-zero. Manually-injected grabs and AthenaScout-driven requests
will set higher priority in later phases; the IRC dispatcher uses
priority 0.

Pop ordering: highest priority first, then oldest queued_at first.
The `idx_pending_queue_priority` index in the schema makes this a
single-row indexed read.

Like `ledger.py`, every function takes an `aiosqlite.Connection`
explicitly. We don't open or close connections here.
