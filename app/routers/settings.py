"""
Settings read + patch endpoints.

    GET   /api/v1/settings         — current settings with secrets redacted
    PATCH /api/v1/settings         — update settings (shared helper)

Secrets (mam_session_id, mam_irc_password, qbit_password, abs_api_key,
hardcover_api_key, and the auth secret) are NEVER returned verbatim;
the GET endpoint replaces each with a `{key}_configured` boolean.

The PATCH endpoint delegates to `apply_settings_patch()`, which is
ALSO called by the discovery-domain POST /api/discovery/settings
endpoint (used by the setup wizard). Keeping both endpoints share
one code path means there's exactly one write policy — any drift
between "what the main Settings page can save" and "what the setup
wizard writes" can't happen.

Write policy:
  - Runtime-state keys (written by background jobs) are rejected.
  - Secret keys are routed through the encrypted store, not
    settings.json. Masked/truncated values are ignored so the UI
    can safely re-submit a redacted settings dict.
  - Unknown keys (not present in DEFAULT_SETTINGS) are rejected.
  - Everything else saves.

Post-save, all three live-reload hooks fire:
  - dispatcher rebuild (pipeline background loops)
  - metadata source reload (discovery lookup + scan config)
  - logging level re-application (verbose_logging toggle)
so changes take effect without a container restart.
