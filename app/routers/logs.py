"""
Log viewer endpoint.

    GET /api/v1/logs?lines=200&filter=announce

Reads from Seshat's in-memory log buffer. Uses Python's logging
module to capture recent log records into a bounded deque, so no
file I/O is needed and the endpoint works regardless of how the
container's stdout is configured.

Two views for the UI:
  - "all" — full application log (dispatcher, budget watcher, IRC,
    pipeline, enricher, etc.)
  - "announces" — just the IRC announce events (filtered by logger
    name prefix "seshat.mam.irc" or message content)

The buffer is capped at 5000 records to limit memory usage. Older
records are evicted FIFO. The endpoint returns newest-first so the
UI doesn't need to scroll to the bottom.
