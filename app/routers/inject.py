"""
Manual grab-injection HTTP endpoint.

POST /api/v1/grabs/inject

Two callers hit this endpoint:

  1. **Cookie-rotation manual test recipe** — paste a torrent ID,
     verify the full grab path works, then rotate the cookie and
     repeat to verify the failure + retry flow.
  2. **Operator manual override** — when an announce is missed
     (Seshat was offline) and the operator wants to grab it
     anyway from the MAM web UI's "Recent Activity" page.

The endpoint reads the dispatcher singleton out of `app.state`,
calls `inject_grab`, and serializes the result as JSON. Session
auth (auth_secret cookie) is enforced by the global middleware.
