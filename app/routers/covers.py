"""
Cover image serving endpoint.

    GET /api/v1/covers/{path:path} — serve a cover image from disk

The review queue and tentative list store cover paths as absolute
filesystem paths. The UI can't access those directly — this endpoint
serves them through the auth middleware so the browser can display
them as regular <img> tags.

Security: the path is validated to ensure it lives under one of the
known staging/cover directories. Arbitrary path traversal is
blocked by checking that the resolved path starts with the
configured staging_path or review_staging_path.
