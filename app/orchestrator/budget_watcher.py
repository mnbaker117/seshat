"""
Snatch budget watcher loop.

Periodically:
  1. Polls qBittorrent for the current state of every torrent in
     the watch category
  2. Calls `ledger.reconcile_with_qbit()` to update seedtimes and
     release rows that have hit the threshold (or vanished from qBit)
  3. As long as the ledger has freed-up budget, pops grabs from
     `pending_queue` and submits them to qBit, recording each in
     the ledger

This is the function that turns the static "park grabs in a queue
when budget is full" logic into a real flow that actually drains
the queue when MAM seedtime catches up. Without it, queued grabs
would sit forever — the dispatcher only ever ENQUEUES.

The loop is designed for the same supervised-task wrapper as the
IRC listener: it's an infinite `while not stop.is_set()` body that
sleeps between iterations, can be cancelled cleanly, and never
raises out of the body (everything is logged and the loop continues).

The loop body is split into a separate `tick()` function so tests
can drive one cycle at a time without dealing with timers.
