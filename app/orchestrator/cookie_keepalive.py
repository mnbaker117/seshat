"""
MAM cookie keep-alive loop.

MAM's session cookie has a sliding-window expiration: every API call
the backend receives RESETS the timer (and rotates the cookie value
via the Set-Cookie response header). As long as Seshat makes at
least one API call within a 15-day window, the cookie stays alive
indefinitely. Stop calling MAM for 15+ days and the cookie expires
silently — the next grab attempt will then fail with the
`cookie_expired` failure mode and the user has to manually paste a
new cookie.

The keep-alive loop exists to make 15-day idle periods impossible.
On a fixed interval (default 7 days = half the safety window) it
hits MAM's search endpoint with a tiny throwaway payload. The call
itself returns nothing useful — what matters is that MAM's cookie
rotation fires on the response, which:

  1. Resets MAM's expiration clock
  2. Updates Seshat's in-memory token via the rotation handler
  3. Schedules the debounced settings.json persist

Same shape as the budget watcher: a `tick()` function that does one
cycle, plus a `run_loop()` wrapper that supervises it. Tests target
`tick()` for fast in-process verification; the lifespan supervises
`run_loop()` in production.

Why 7 days and not e.g. 1 day:

  - Every grab and every IRC announce already triggers rotation, so
    in practice the cookie is rotating constantly during normal
    operation. Keep-alive only matters when ALL of those have been
    silent — which is rare.
  - Hitting MAM more often than necessary is bad citizenship and
    eats into MAM's API allowance.
  - 7 days is comfortably under the 15-day window even with ample
    margin for crashes, restarts, and clock skew.

Adjustable via `cookie_keepalive_interval_hours` in settings.json.

      - It's already used by the validation flow (one less code
