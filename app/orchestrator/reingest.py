"""
Reingest already-snatched torrents from disk into the Seshat pipeline.

The "Send to pipeline" button on Discovery's MAM-matched books hides
when MAM reports `my_snatched=true` — the user already pulled that
torrent at some point (often long before Seshat existed). For those
cases the file already lives on disk (or in qBit) and the user wants
to flow it through enrichment + manual review WITHOUT re-snatching
from MAM (snatch-safety rule: never re-download the same .torrent).

This module discovers where the existing snatch lives and hands the
result to the same pipeline path a fresh grab would take — minus
the MAM .torrent fetch and qBit submit steps. Two resolvers, in
priority order:

  1. **qBit candidates** — walk qBit's `list_torrents()` and match by
     torrent name (exact, then prefix/substring fallback). For each
     match we know the save_path + file list authoritatively without
     touching the disk. Preferred because qBit is the source of truth
     for in-flight seeding torrents.
  2. **Filesystem candidates** — recursively walk the configured
     `qbit_download_path` (translated to Seshat's mount via
     `qbit_path_prefix`/`local_path_prefix`) looking for files or
     directories whose name matches the MAM torrent name. Used for
     "grandfather'd" snatches that predate Seshat: there's no qBit
     hash recorded anywhere, but the file may still be on disk.

A single match → start the pipeline immediately. Multiple matches →
return candidate list for user disambiguation. Zero matches →
return `found=False` so the UI can surface a "not found anywhere"
error (per the v2.8.0 design: option (a), no auto-fallback to a
re-snatch).

    Side effects:
      - Inserts a `grabs` row with `state=STATE_DOWNLOADED`,
        `is_reingest=1`, and the qBit hash if known. NO MAM .torrent
        fetch occurs — the .torrent never enters the snatch_ledger
        or counts against the budget. NO qBit submit occurs — the
        torrent is either already loaded (qBit candidate) or only
        exists as files on disk (fs candidate).
      - Inserts a `pipeline_runs` row in the standard initial state
        so the budget watcher / pipeline state machine see a
        complete-shaped run from the moment it's reingested.
      - Calls `process_completion` directly with `torrent_files`
        populated from the candidate, bypassing the qBit "download
        finished" detection step that would otherwise wait for a
        non-existent submission to complete.
