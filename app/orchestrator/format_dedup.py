"""
Format-priority dedup logic (v2.9.0).

Decides whether an announce that passed the filter gate should:

  * be grabbed immediately ("allow") — possibly preempting an in-flight
    lower-priority hold of the same book;
  * be parked in `pending_holds` for `format_dedup_hold_seconds`
    ("hold") so a higher-priority sibling has a chance to arrive
    before we commit to grabbing a lower-priority format;
  * be skipped because a higher-priority sibling is already in flight
    or because the book is already Owned in some format ("skip").

The four user-facing scenarios from the v2.9.0 spec map onto this gate:

  Scenario 1 — highest-priority arrives, nothing else races          → allow
  Scenario 2 — higher-priority already in flight, lower arrives      → skip
  Scenario 3 — disabled-only arrives, nothing else races             → hold,
               then grab when the timer fires
  Scenario 3.5 — higher-priority arrives later (even after the lower
               was already Owned)                                    → allow
               (the user ends up with both formats in Calibre,
               which is fine — Calibre stores N formats per book)

Plus the v2.9.0 design's "Delves preempt" case:

  Disabled lower-priority is currently held; a higher-priority enabled
  format arrives during the hold window → allow the higher AND drop
  the lower's hold (preempt_hold_ids).

This module is intentionally pure — `evaluate_format_dedup` takes
the announce, the user's `format_priority` setting, the hold window,
and a pre-fetched list of `SiblingMatch` objects. The caller does
the actual DB writes (insert grab / insert hold / drop preempted
holds) inside one BEGIN IMMEDIATE so the four-way race window
between two concurrent announces never produces double-grabs.

The companion async helper `lookup_dedup_siblings` does the impure
work — querying `grabs`, `pending_holds`, and the per-library `books`
tables — so production callers get a one-call data fetch and tests
can stub by passing siblings directly.
