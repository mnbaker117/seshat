"""
The dispatcher.

Two public functions, both following the same shape:

  - `handle_announce(deps, announce)` — called by the IRC listener
    for every parsed announce. Runs the filter, evaluates the rate
    limiter, fetches the .torrent file (if allowed), submits to
    the download client (if budget allows), and updates all the
    persistence layers in the right order.

  - `inject_grab(deps, torrent_id, ...)` — called by the manual-
    inject HTTP endpoint. Skips the filter (the user already
    decided they want this) but still goes through the rate
    limiter so a manually-injected grab respects the snatch budget.

The `Dispatcher` dataclass below is the dependency container —
everything the dispatcher needs is passed in explicitly so the
tests can construct one with fakes and verify the orchestration
without any global state. In production, `main.py`'s lifespan
builds a singleton Dispatcher with real implementations and
hands it to the IRC listener and the inject router.

State transitions written by this module:

    decide=submit, fetch ok, client ok       → STATE_SUBMITTED
    decide=submit, fetch=cookie_expired    → STATE_FAILED_COOKIE_EXPIRED
    decide=submit, fetch=torrent_not_found → STATE_FAILED_TORRENT_GONE
    decide=submit, fetch=other failure     → STATE_FAILED_UNKNOWN
    decide=submit, fetch ok, client reject → STATE_FAILED_QBIT_REJECTED
    decide=submit, fetch ok, client auth   → STATE_PENDING_QUEUE (queued for retry)
    decide=queue,  fetch ok               → STATE_PENDING_QUEUE (queued)
    decide=queue,  fetch failure          → same as submit-failure
    decide=drop                           → no grab row, only audit
