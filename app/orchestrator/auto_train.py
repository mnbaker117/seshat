"""
Auto-train: feed successfully-grabbed authors back to the filter.

When a book is successfully processed through the pipeline, the
author(s) from the metadata are added to the `authors_allowed` table
(if not already present) so future announces by the same author
pass the filter automatically.

This closes the feedback loop:
  IRC announce → filter → grab → download → metadata → auto-train
                   ↑                                        ↓
                   └────────── authors_allowed ←────────────┘

The auto-train only adds to the allow list — it never removes or
modifies existing entries, and it never touches the ignore list.
Authors added by auto-train get `source = "auto_train"` so the UI
can distinguish them from manually-curated entries.
