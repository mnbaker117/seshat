"""
Post-download completion detector.

`check_for_completions()` scans the qBit snapshot for grabs in
`submitted` state whose torrent has finished downloading (state is
no longer "downloading", "metaDL", "stalledDL", etc.). For each
newly-completed grab, it:

  1. Transitions the grab to `downloaded`
  2. Creates a `pipeline_runs` row in `staged` state
  3. Returns the list of newly-detected completions

This module is called by the budget watcher's tick — not as a
separate polling loop — because both need the same qBit snapshot.
No extra HTTP round-trips.

qBit download states (torrent is still downloading):
  - downloading, forcedDL, metaDL, stalledDL, checkingDL,
    queuedDL, allocating, moving

qBit post-download states (torrent has finished):
  - uploading, forcedUP, pausedUP, stalledUP, checkingUP,
    queuedUP, stoppedUP

We treat any state NOT in the "downloading" set as "download complete".

# `_prepare_book` can't locate the expected filename, and
# `_fail()` marks the pipeline_run as failed with
# `"torrent files unavailable from client; no file matching ..."`.
# Seconds later qBit finishes the move, but the failed pipeline_run
# row is what `check_for_completions` sees — its existence is the
# gate that prevents reprocessing.
#
# Auto-retry: on each watcher tick, scan for pipeline_runs in that
# exact failure shape and past a short cooldown, delete the old
# failed run and re-create a fresh one so the pipeline re-tries
# against the now-moved files. A module-level counter keeps us from
# runaway-retrying a grab when the underlying issue isn't transient
# (e.g. torrent actually missing from qBit's mount). The counter
# resets on process restart by design — at that point an operator
# has restarted the container and is presumably watching for the
# next attempt anyway.

    Handles the manual-add workflow: user downloads a .torrent from
    MAM and drops it into qBit directly (or any other non-Seshat
    tool puts a torrent in the watched category). Without a grabs
    row the download watcher silently ignores the completion, so
    manually-added books never flow through the pipeline.

    We insert one row per unknown qBit hash with state=submitted and
    qbit_hash set. `check_for_completions()` on the same tick picks
    up any that are already done; ones still downloading get caught
    on a future tick.

    `adoption_cutoff` is a Unix timestamp — only torrents with
    `added_on >= adoption_cutoff` are considered. This is load-
    bearing: without it, the first tick after deploying the adopter
    code re-adopts EVERY pre-existing torrent in the watch category
    (which on a long-running qBit instance can be thousands of
    already-processed books), flooding the review queue and
    re-staging files that were delivered months ago. The caller
    seeds the cutoff on first run to the current time, meaning only
    freshly-added torrents after the upgrade get adopted. Pass 0 to
    disable the time filter entirely (tests only).

    MAM-safe: zero outbound traffic. Pure local observation.

    `mam_torrent_id` is intentionally blank — we didn't fetch this
    from MAM, so there's no authoritative ID to record. Callers that
    need provenance can filter on `category = 'manual_add'`.
