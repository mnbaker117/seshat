"""
Post-download pipeline orchestrator.

The post-download pipeline has two halves with a mandatory manual
review queue between them:

    HALF 1 (`process_completion`):
        1. Locate book files in the download directory
        2. Optionally copy to staging
        3. Extract + enrich metadata (announce + embedded)
        4. Patch metadata into a temp copy of the epub
        5a. If review_queue_enabled: copy the patched file to the
            review staging dir and insert a `book_review_queue` row,
            set pipeline state to `awaiting_review`, STOP. The user
            (or the auto-add timeout job) resumes with `deliver_reviewed`.
        5b. If review_queue_enabled is False (legacy/direct path):
            fall straight through to HALF 2.

    HALF 2 (`deliver_reviewed`):
        6. Route to the configured sink
        7. Auto-train: add author(s) to the allow list
        8. Send ntfy notification
        9. Record a calibre_additions row + mark pipeline complete

The split matters because CWA's inotify watcher only reacts to the
final atomic rename — if we handed CWA a partial or unenriched file
during review, it would ingest it before the user could approve or
edit the metadata. Keeping the patched file in a separate review
staging dir until the user signs off is what makes the manual review
step actually manual.
