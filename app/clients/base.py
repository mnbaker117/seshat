"""
Torrent client contract.

The `TorrentClient` Protocol is the interface every concrete client
implements. It's small on purpose — Seshat only needs four
operations:

  1. login()                       — establish a session
  2. add_torrent(...)              — submit a .torrent file
  3. list_torrents(category=...)   — for the qBit poller / budget watcher
  4. get_torrent(hash)             — for budget release detection

The shared dataclasses (`AddResult`, `TorrentInfo`) are deliberately
client-agnostic so the rest of Seshat never has to know whether
it's talking to qBittorrent, Deluge, or anything else. Failure
classification is the caller's job; a concrete client maps native
errors into the `failure_kind` enum below.
