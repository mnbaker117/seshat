"""
v2.16.0 Data Hygiene Command Center action.

A single user-triggered run fans six chained jobs across every
configured library:

  1. Empty author + series cleanup
  2. Hardcover -> goodreads_id / openlibrary_id / google_books_id
     backfill (depends on the v2.16.0 Gap 1 fix; reuses Hardcover's
     `book_mappings` table on a batched per-book query)
  3. Phase-2 author goodreads_id backfill (reverse-lookup from any
     book carrying a resolvable identifier — reuses
     `backfill_missing_author_ids`)
  4. Book deduplication pass (identifier-keyed + same-series-position
     — reuses `_dedupe_same_series_position` plus an explicit
     identifier-grouping sweep that calls `merge_books` per pair)
  5. Series consolidation (intra-author canonical-form merge —
     reuses `_dedupe_intra_author_series`)
  6. ABS author name-match cross-stamp (cheap cross-library copy of
     `goodreads_id` / `hardcover_id` / `openlibrary_id` /
     `google_books_id` from enriched ebook authors to ABS authors of
     the same normalized name)

Universal rules applied across every job:

  - **Skip hidden items**. Cleanup + dedup jobs filter `hidden = 0`
    in their working sets. Identifier-class writes (stamping a
    discovered goodreads_id onto a row) ignore hidden state because
    the columns are scaffolding, not user-curated content — same
    rule the live scan layer follows.
  - **Idempotent**. Re-running back-to-back is a near-no-op. Each
    job's "fixes" counter drops to 0 once steady state is reached.
  - **Preserve `authors_allowed` by name**. The empty-cleanup job
    refuses to delete any author whose normalized name appears in
    the global allow-list, even if their books were all removed —
    that allow-list is the user's authorial-allowlist of record.

Coordinator surface:

  - `run_all(...)` — the chained entry point. Drives
    `state._hygiene_progress` per-step and returns a stats dict.
  - `POST /api/discovery/hygiene/run` (in
    `app/discovery/routers/hygiene.py`) spawns it as a background
    task and returns immediately; the existing scan-status banner
    polls `/discovery/scan-status` for progress.
