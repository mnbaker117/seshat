"""
Goodreads author-id reverse-lookup (v2.13.0).

Closes the long-deferred v2.11.0 wiring gap: when a Seshat author has
no stored `goodreads_id` (so `_try_source` can't short-circuit and
the `search_author` policy lock makes Goodreads inert for that
author's source-scans), this module resolves the author's
goodreads_id from one of their books.

Strategy (cheapest-first):

  1. Pick a book for this author with the strongest available
     identifier:

       a. `books.goodreads_id` already stored on the book
          → derive directly, zero resolver hops
       b. `books.isbn` populated
          → resolver chain (auto_complete / hardcover book_mappings /
            openlibrary) returns the goodreads_book_id
       c. `books.asin` populated
          → same resolver chain

  2. With a goodreads_book_id in hand, fetch `/book/show/{id}` via
     the v2.13.0 `goodreads_session` (curl_cffi Chrome120 bypass).

  3. Parse the response's JSON-LD `author[].url` (or `sameAs`) for
     the `/author/show/{id}` pattern. That's the author's
     goodreads_id.

  4. Persist to `authors.goodreads_id`. Future source-scans pick it
     up via the existing `_try_source` short-circuit and fan out
     `/author/list/{id}` + per-book detail fetches.

  5. Return the resolved id, or `None` on any failure (no book with
     resolvable identifier, resolver chain dry, /book/show 4xx, no
     parseable author URL, etc.).

Used by:

  - `_try_source` in `app/discovery/lookup.py` — fallback when
    Goodreads's stored author_id is missing, BEFORE letting
    `search_author` no-op.
  - The async backfill task that runs after Calibre sync (sweeps
    every author missing a goodreads_id, populates whatever it can).

Both callers share the same code path so the rate-limit + soft-block
detection + caching come along for free.

    Rate-limit comes for free from `goodreads_session` (5s + 0–1s

    `soft_blocked` and the next iteration's `goodreads_session.get`

    pounding Cloudflare during a soft-block window, we short-circuit
    on `is_soft_blocked()` and abort the sweep early. Picks up on
