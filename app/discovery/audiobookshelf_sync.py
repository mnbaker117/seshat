"""
Audiobookshelf library sync.

Pulls the user's ABS library via the REST API and upserts into Seshat's
discovery database. Mirrors the three-pass shape of `calibre_sync.py`
(authors → series → books) so the ordering guarantees and ownership-flip
logic behave identically for audiobook libraries.

Unlike Calibre, ABS carries audiobook-specific metadata: narrator,
duration, abridged flag, ASIN, audio file formats. Those populate
columns that are null in ebook-library DBs and non-null here.

Progress is reported through the same `state._library_sync_progress`
widget as Calibre, so the unified Dashboard "Syncing N/M" display
works the same for both library types.
