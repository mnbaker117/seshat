"""Per-library sync state.

Tracks last-observed source mtime, last successful sync wall-clock
timestamp, and last *full* sync timestamp. Drives the incremental-vs-
full decision in `sync_calibre` / `sync_audiobookshelf`.

State shape (under `settings["library_sync_state"]`):

    {
        "<slug>": {
            "last_mtime":         <number or string, from get_mtime()>,
            "last_sync_ts":       <float unix seconds — success of ANY sync>,
            "last_full_sync_ts":  <float unix seconds — success of a FULL sync>,
        }
    }

Why three fields:
- `last_mtime`        — gates the mtime fast-path skip (existing behavior).
- `last_sync_ts`      — floor for the `last_modified > X` incremental query.
- `last_full_sync_ts` — weekly safety-net trigger; a full sync periodically
                       re-covers any drift the incremental path might miss
                       (e.g. external scripts that bypass `calibredb` and
                       write directly to metadata.db without bumping
                       last_modified).

    state — the legacy `library_mtimes` shape never tracked
    timestamps), this is our chance to anchor sync_state on a moment
    when the library is *verified* current.

    Without this backfill, a post-migration mtime-skip leaves the
    timestamps at zero. When something *does* eventually change, the
    next real sync hits `resolve_threshold` with `last_full_sync_ts=0`
    → `MODE_FULL_FIRST` → forced full sync, even though we already
    confirmed no work was needed back when mtime-skip fired. Mark hit
    exactly this 2026-05-11: initial restart did mtime-skip (no
    backfill, timestamps stayed zero), he added one ebook, second
    restart's Calibre sync was full instead of incremental.

    Conservative semantics — never overwrites existing non-zero
    timestamps. Once a real sync has stamped them, mtime-skip is a
    no-op for sync_state. Also refreshes `last_mtime` so a composite-
    shape change (e.g., ABS's 2-field → 3-field migration in v2.6)
