"""
MyAnonamouse integration endpoints.

This router orchestrates every MAM scan path the UI exposes:

  - Manual batched scan (/api/mam/scan)            — chips through every
    book missing MAM data, in 150-book batches with a 1-minute pause
    between each. Snapshots eligible IDs at start so a concurrent
    author scan adding new books does NOT grow this scan's queue.
  - Single-book rescan (/api/mam/scan-book/{id})   — used by the
    "Re-scan MAM" button in BookSidebar to refresh a stale match.
  - Single-author scan (/api/mam/scan-author/{id}) — runs as a
    background task tracked through the unified scan widget so the
    user can Stop it mid-run.
  - Full library scan (/api/mam/full-scan)         — long-running,
    400 books per batch with a 5-minute pause. State lives in the
    `mam_scan_log` table so it survives process restarts.

All scan paths share `_mam_scan_progress` in app.state and serialize
through the same "one MAM scan at a time" lock so the unified widget
always reflects exactly one in-flight MAM job.

Other endpoints in this router: /validate (test session), /status
(stats + scan health), /books (paged book list for the MAM page),
/toggle (feature flag), /reset (wipe all mam_* fields).

    Three kinds of MAM scan can be active at once (in theory), each

      - Manual scan (POST /mam/scan):  runs as `_mam_scan_task` and
        is cancelled via `task.cancel()` — the CancelledError
        propagates through the await and the task's own handler
        flips `running` to False.
      - Scheduled scan (via `_mam_scheduler`): runs inline inside
        the long-lived scheduler loop, NOT as a discrete task, so
        `task.cancel()` would kill the whole scheduler. Instead we
        set `_scheduled_mam_cancel_requested` — the scheduler's
        `mam_scan_batch` call receives it through a `cancel_check`
        closure and aborts at the next per-book boundary. The
        scheduler also bumps `last_scan_at` after the cancel so
        its next-tick re-trigger doesn't fire a new scan immediately
        (you'd see a cancel-then-instant-restart otherwise).
      - Full scan (POST /mam/full-scan): has its own endpoint at
        /mam/full-scan/cancel — this endpoint explicitly doesn't
        touch `_mam_full_scan_task` to avoid overlap.

    Pre-v1.1.9 this endpoint only handled the manual case, so
    clicking Stop on a scheduled scan silently did nothing and
    the misleading "No MAM scan running" fallback response made
