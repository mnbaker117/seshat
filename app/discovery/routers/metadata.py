"""
v2.3.4 Metadata Manager backend.

Surfaces the dual-storage data model (`books`, `books_calibre_snapshot`,
`books_abs_snapshot`, `metadata_review_queue`) to two front-end pieces:

  - **Compare panel** (book sidebar) — `/books/{bid}/compare` returns
    Seshat-live + Calibre snapshot + ABS snapshot side-by-side, with
    per-field diff flags for UI highlighting. `/books/{bid}/pull`
    copies one or more snapshot fields into Seshat-live and flags
    them as user-edited so the next sync's auto-flow doesn't roll
    the change back.

  - **Metadata Manager page** (top-level) — `/queue` lists pending
    review-queue rows grouped by source, `/queue/{id}/apply` writes
    `new_value` to the books table and deletes the queue row,
    `/queue/{id}/dismiss` deletes the row without writing.

The legacy `series-suggestions` table stays — `/queue/series-moves`
exposes it under the same review-queue mental model so the
Suggestions page can retire (its functionality folds into the
Metadata Manager's "Series moves" tab).
