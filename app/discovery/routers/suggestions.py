"""
Series suggestion review and disposition endpoints.

Source-consensus suggestion rows are written by
`lookup.py:_compute_series_suggestions` during author scans whenever
2+ sources agree on a series name or index that differs from what's
currently stored on the book. This router is the user-facing surface
for those rows: list pending suggestions, apply one (write the
consensus value back to the book), ignore one (suppress re-suggestion
of the same value), or delete a row entirely.

Drift detection: each suggestion stores a snapshot of the book's
series state at the time it was created. The list endpoint also
returns the LIVE series state via a JOIN, so the frontend can flag
when the two have diverged — typically because the user manually
edited the book between suggestion creation and review, in which
case the diff may no longer reflect a real disagreement.
