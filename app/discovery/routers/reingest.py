"""
Reingest endpoints — pull an already-snatched torrent from disk into
the Seshat pipeline without re-snatching from MAM.

When MAM reports a book as `my_snatched=true` (the user already
downloaded that torrent at some point, often before Seshat existed)
the discovery row gets flagged and the standard "Send to pipeline"
button is hidden — Seshat must never re-download a snatched torrent
(MAM duplicate-snatch penalty per the snatch-safety rule).

These endpoints expose a separate "Reingest from disk" path that:
  1. Probes qBit + the configured download folder for the existing
     files.
  2. Returns up to 5 candidates for the user to pick from (or
     auto-starts if exactly one is found).
  3. Hands the chosen candidate to the orchestrator's `start_reingest`
     helper, which synthesizes a `grabs` row (`is_reingest=1`,
     `state=STATE_DOWNLOADED`), creates a `pipeline_run`, and calls
     `process_completion` directly — skipping the MAM .torrent fetch
     and qBit submit phases that a normal grab would run.

Slug correctness: both endpoints require `?slug=` per
`feedback_seshat_multi_library_slug.md` since the books table is
per-library. Without it a numeric id collision across libraries
would let one library's reingest mutate another library's book.
