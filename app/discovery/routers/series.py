Series endpoints — list, detail, and v2.3 Series Manager mutations.

  GET    /api/series                — every series the user has at
                                      least one visible book for, with
                                      owned/missing counts and
                                      multi-author flag
  GET    /api/series/{sid}          — full series detail with the
                                      ordered book list and per-book
                                      ownership state
  GET    /api/series/{sid}/authors  — distinct author list for a
                                      series with per-author book
                                      counts (drives the v2.3.3
                                      Manage Members modal)
  POST   /api/series/promote        — internal/escape hatch: merge
                                      2+ per-author rows into one
                                      shared row. No longer surfaced

                                      author-level endpoints below.
  POST   /api/series/{sid}/demote   — internal/escape hatch: split a
                                      shared row into per-author rows.
                                      Same status as promote — kept
                                      for the calibre_sync auto-detect
                                      path and as a recovery tool.
  POST   /api/series/{sid}/authors  — assign one author's books to
                                      this series; auto-flips
                                      authority on the destination
                                      and on every source series the
                                      books moved off of
  DELETE /api/series/{sid}/authors/{author_id}
                                    — detach all of one author's
                                      books from this series; books
                                      fall back to standalone
  PATCH  /api/series/{sid}          — rename a series
  DELETE /api/series/{sid}          — delete; books fall back to
                                      standalone (series_id=NULL)
  POST   /api/series/{sid}/books    — bulk-add books to this series
  DELETE /api/series/{sid}/books/{book_id} — detach a single book

The mutation endpoints are the v2.3 Series Manager backend. They
exist in addition to (not in place of) the auto-detect path in
calibre_sync.py — which handles the common case (Calibre-organized
shared series like Halo) without user intervention. The mutations
cover edge cases: source-discovered books that aren't yet in
Calibre, manual relabeling, undoing an auto-decision the user
disagreed with.

Authority auto-flip (v2.3.3): every membership-mutating endpoint
calls `_recompute_series_author` on the series whose membership
changed (and on every source series for cross-series moves). The
rule: 1 distinct author → series.author_id = that author;
2+ distinct authors → NULL (shared); 0 books → no-op. So the user
no longer thinks in "promote/demote" verbs — they manage author
membership and authority follows.

Both list/detail endpoints honor the global hidden-book filter so
the totals shown in the UI match what the user actually sees on
book pages.

         again).
      2. Pick (or accept) the canonical shared name.
      3. UPSERT the shared row keyed on (LOWER(name), author_id IS NULL).
         Re-uses an existing shared row by that name if one exists,
         otherwise INSERTs a fresh one.
      4. UPDATE every book pointing at any of the source rows to
         point at the shared row instead.
      5. DELETE the source rows.

    Idempotent on accidental re-runs: a second promote with the same
    series_ids 404s on the now-deleted rows. Wrap in a single
    transaction so partial failure doesn't leave a half-merged state.
