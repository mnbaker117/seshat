Series endpoints — list and detail.

  GET /api/series         — every series the user has at least one
                            visible book for, with owned/missing
                            counts and multi-author flag
  GET /api/series/{sid}   — full series detail with the ordered
                            book list and per-book ownership state

Both endpoints honor the global hidden-book filter so the totals
shown in the UI match what the user actually sees on book pages.
