"""
Scan-orchestration endpoints.

Three scan kinds run through this router:
  - Library sync: imports the user's curated library (Calibre today,
    other backends in the future) into the discovery DB.
  - Author/source lookup: hits Goodreads/Hardcover/Kobo for each author.
  - Full re-scan: same as lookup but visits every book page to refresh
    metadata, ignoring the cache window.

Plus the unified `/scan-status` endpoint that the Dashboard polls so it
can render every active scan side-by-side, regardless of which router
actually started the scan. The lookup-specific and MAM-specific status
endpoints still exist (consumed by the MAMPage and SettingsPage), so
this file *projects* the underlying state dicts into a uniform shape
rather than restructuring them.

Endpoints:
  /api/sync/library, /api/sync, /api/sync/calibre     — manual library sync
  /api/sync/lookup, /api/lookup                       — start author scan
  /api/lookup/cancel, /api/lookup/status              — control + status
  /api/sync/full-rescan                               — full re-scan
  /api/scan-status                                    — unified Dashboard feed
  /api/scanning/{author,mam}/toggle                   — feature on/off
