"""
Author endpoints — list, detail, scan triggers, and reset operations.

The author scan triggers in this file all funnel through
`_spawn_lookup_task`, which manages the single-author / single-author-
full-rescan / bulk-authors paths as background asyncio tasks tracked
through `state._lookup_task` + `state._lookup_progress`. This is what
makes the Dashboard widget's "Stop" button work uniformly regardless
of where the scan was kicked off from.

Endpoints:
  GET  /api/authors                       — paginated list with filters
  GET  /api/authors/{aid}                 — detail with series & standalone
  POST /api/authors/{aid}/lookup          — single-author source scan
  POST /api/authors/{aid}/full-rescan     — single-author full re-scan
  POST /api/authors/clear-scan-data       — wipe source/MAM data per author set
  POST /api/authors/scan-sources          — bulk source scan
  POST /api/authors/scan-mam              — bulk MAM scan
  POST /api/sources/reset                 — global source-scan reset
