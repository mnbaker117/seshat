"""
Calibre library sync.

Reads Calibre's `metadata.db` (read-only, via SQLite URI mode) and
upserts the user's library into AthenaScout's database. Runs in three
passes — authors, series, books — so foreign key targets exist before
the rows that reference them get inserted.

Calibre is the user's curated source of truth. Everything this module
imports is flagged `owned=1`, and the merge layer in `lookup.py`
protects calibre-sourced rows with field-level rules so source scans
can enrich metadata without ever clobbering curated content. The
"match external books by title" pass at the end of book upsert is the
inverse: a book the user just added to Calibre may already exist in
the DB as an unowned discovery from a previous source scan, and we
flip its `owned` bit instead of creating a duplicate.

Sync surfaces progress via `state._library_sync_progress` so the
unified Dashboard widget can show "Syncing 142/675 — The Final Empire"
the same way it shows MAM/source scan progress.
