"""
Calibre library sync.

Reads Calibre's `metadata.db` (read-only, via SQLite URI mode) and
upserts the user's library into the discovery database. Runs in three
passes — authors, series, books — so foreign key targets exist before
the rows that reference them get inserted.

Calibre is the user's curated source of truth. Everything this module
imports is flagged `owned=1`, and the merge layer in `lookup.py`
protects calibre-sourced rows with field-level rules so source scans
can enrich metadata without ever clobbering curated content. The
"match external books by title" pass at the end of book upsert is the
inverse: a book the user just added to Calibre may already exist in
the DB as an unowned discovery from a previous source scan, and we
flip its `owned` bit instead of creating a duplicate.

Sync surfaces progress via `state._library_sync_progress` so the
unified Dashboard widget can show "Syncing 142/675 — The Final Empire"
the same way it shows MAM/source scan progress.

    Three passes, in this exact order (because each pass needs the FK
    targets from the previous one to exist):
      1. Authors — upsert by name, link calibre_id.
      2. Series  — upsert by lowercased name, scoped to author for
                   uniqueness but matched globally so multi-author
                   series collapse to one row.
      3. Books   — upsert by (calibre_id, source='calibre'), then run
                   a "flip ownership" pass that marks pre-existing
                   discovery rows as owned when they title-match the
                   book we just imported.

    Mode is decided by `sync_state.resolve_threshold` against the
    persisted per-slug state. Incremental mode reads only books whose
    Calibre `last_modified` is newer than the last successful sync
    (with a 60s drift bias), supplemented by a cheap shallow full read
    so Pass 2's multi-author series detection still sees every book.
    Full mode runs on first sync, weekly safety-net intervals, and
    after a recorded failure.

    Paths default to `CALIBRE_DB_PATH` / `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_PATH` from
