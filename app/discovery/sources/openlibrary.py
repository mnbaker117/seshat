"""
Open Library discovery source — sanctioned REST API.

Open Library publishes a free, no-key REST API at openlibrary.org.
Two-phase shape mirrors the v2.10.5 Hardcover pattern:

  1. Author lookup via `/search/authors.json?q={name}`. Returns a
     ranked list of author records with `key`, `name`, and
     `work_count`. Disambiguate by strict name match + work_count
     tiebreaker.
  2. Walk the author's works via `/authors/{key}/works.json`,
     paginated with `limit` + `offset`. One round-trip per page.

Open Library is data-quality dependent — coverage is good for
older / well-cataloged books, sparse for indie self-pub. We
accept everything OL returns and let downstream consensus
handle merge with richer sources (Hardcover, Goodreads-when-
available).

Series information: OL doesn't have a first-class series
concept. We attempt extraction from the work's title pattern
("Mistborn (Mistborn, #1)") and fall back to standalone. Most
series-rich books will get their series filled in by other
sources during the consensus merge.

Editions / ISBN / page count / language: deferred to v2.11.x.
Each work would require an additional `/works/{key}/editions.json`
fetch — N+1 cost would dominate scan time. The work-level
metadata (title, description, cover, first_publish_year) is
enough for discovery; richer sources backfill the rest.

        record. Most authors resolve to exactly one key; multiple keys
        signal that OL has split the same person across records (common
        for translated authors who exist as both a romanized record and
        a native-script record).

        Resolution chain (v2.11.0):

        1. **Variant queries** — try the input name verbatim; if OL
           returns 0 hits, retry with whitespace-stripped initials
           ("K.D." ↔ "K. D."). OL's full-text search is whitespace-
           sensitive on initials so this single query change recovers
           authors like K.D. Robertson that would otherwise FAIL.

        2. **Strict-name aggregation** — among the returned docs,
           include every record whose name strictly normalizes to the
           target (lowercase, periods/spaces stripped). Case variants
           like "Isuna Hasekura" / "ISUNA HASEKURA" / "Isuna HASEKURA"
           all aggregate together.

        3. **Cross-script aggregation** — also include any non-Latin
           script record (CJK / hiragana / katakana / hangul) whose
           work_count exceeds the strict-match maximum. OL routinely
           returns the canonical Japanese record for a romanized
           query, but the strict-name gate would otherwise discard it
           because "支倉凍砂" doesn't normalize to "isunahasekura".
           Work-count dominance is the signal that this is the same
           prolific author, not an unrelated entry.

        4. **Top-hit fallback** — if no record passes either gate,
           return OL's #1-ranked result wrapped in a single-element
           list. Preserves the v2.10.6 behavior for the long tail of
