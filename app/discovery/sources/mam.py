MAM integration.

Looks up each book in the user's library against MAM's torrent catalog so the
UI can show what's already available, what's missing, and what would be a
useful upload.

Authentication:
  MAM session tokens are IP- (or ASN-)locked. The user generates one from
  MAM → Preferences → Security and pastes it into Seshat's settings.
  Before each scan we ping the dynamic-seedbox endpoint to register the
  current IP (skipped for ASN-locked sessions), then run searches with the
  token in a `mam_id` cookie.

Search strategy — five-pass cascade:
  Pass 1 — author + full title
  Pass 2 — author + core title         (volume/series prefix stripped)
  Pass 3 — author + subtitle-right     (part after the colon)
  Pass 4 — author + short title        (part before the colon)
  Pass 5 — title words only            (no author, loose cleaning)
  The cascade short-circuits as soon as a high-confidence match is found;
  the best "possible" across all passes is kept as a fallback.

Format preference:
  When several MAM results match the same book, each is scored by:
    1. Highest-priority ebook format present (user-configurable)
    2. Number of formats available (more = more choice)
  The winner's torrent page is linked. If multiple distinct uploads exist
  for the same book, a flag is set so the UI can show a "multiple" badge.
