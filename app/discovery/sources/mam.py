"""
MAM integration.

Looks up each book in the user's library against MAM's torrent catalog so the
UI can show what's already available, what's missing, and what would be a
useful upload.

Authentication:
  MAM session tokens are IP- (or ASN-)locked. The user generates one from
  MAM → Preferences → Security and pastes it into Seshat's settings.
  Before each scan we ping the dynamic-seedbox endpoint to register the
  current IP (skipped for ASN-locked sessions), then run searches with the
  token in a `mam_id` cookie.

Search strategy — five-pass cascade:
  Pass 1 — author + full title
  Pass 2 — author + core title         (volume/series prefix stripped)
  Pass 3 — author + subtitle-right     (part after the colon)
  Pass 4 — author + short title        (part before the colon)
  Pass 5 — title words only            (no author, loose cleaning)
  The cascade short-circuits as soon as a high-confidence match is found;
  the best "possible" across all passes is kept as a fallback.

Format preference:
  When several MAM results match the same book, each is scored by:
    1. Highest-priority ebook format present (user-configurable)
    2. Number of formats available (more = more choice)
  The winner's torrent page is linked. If multiple distinct uploads exist
  for the same book, a flag is set so the UI can show a "multiple" badge.

    abbreviated (m_tok ⊂ cal_tok), require the cal-side SURNAME
    (last meaningful token) to be present in m_tok. UAT round 5

    surname guard rejects this (cal_surname="reintgen" not in

        surname "sanderson" not in {brandon}). Real fiction MAM

# Sole bundle-content verification signal in v2.4.0+ (the previous

# Torrent Search JSON endpoint (on MAM's approved automation list per
# TOS 1.7) with the `id` and `description` parameters to fetch a single
# torrent's description, then checks whether the searched book title
# appears as a structured list entry.

# Bundle uploaders typically format their content listings as:

# substring would false-positive on prose ("fans of X will love this"),

# `&nbsp;* ` markers, which made the per-line equality check see one
# enormous run-on string with no per-title boundaries. The bullet
# match is intentionally restrictive (requires whitespace OR &nbsp;
# on both sides) to avoid splitting on emphasis (`*word*`) or

    exposure (forum exchange 2026-05-10). Returns the set of torrent_ids
    in the response (empty set on error or no matches; never raises
    except on auth — same pattern as cover and description helpers).

    PERIOD STRIPPING: MAM's author index stores e.g. "Michael R Hicks"
    without the period after the initial. Our Calibre data has the
    period. The strict `@author` operator tokenizes "R." differently
    than "R", which causes zero-result responses on author names with
    period-bearing initials. UAT canary: case 3 (Forged in Flame /
    Michael R. Hicks) returned 0 with periods, 2 results without.
    Stripping all periods is a sound transform — no real author name
    relies on a period for identity, and MAM appears to drop them
    when indexing.

    HYPHEN-DIGIT NORMALIZATION: MAM's filename index treats `Word-N`
    (letter-digit boundary) as a single token. Calibre titles
    sometimes use this as a volume shorthand — UAT 2026-05-11 canary:
    "The Redemption of Maribeth-5" returned 0 from scoped, but
    "Maribeth 5" (space) found the bundle cleanly. The bundle's
    filenames don't contain the literal token "Maribeth-5" anywhere.
    Replacing `\\w-\\d` with a space lets MAM tokenize the digit
    separately. Real letter-LETTER hyphenated titles ("X-Men",
    "Spider-Man", "Half-Elf") are left unchanged.

    `seshat_cover_phash` (optional, hex pHash) enables Part C cover
    verification surfacing. When provided, top-N non-bundle candidates

    `cover_check` field with `distance`, `signal`, and `mam_phash`.
    Unlike production scanning, debug-match runs cover annotation
    UNGATED (regardless of `_COVER_VERIFICATION_ENABLED`) — the whole
    point is to let Mark see the signal even when production won't act
    on it yet.

    `test_scoped` (opt-in) appends three additional passes that probe
    MAM's inline `@field` operator syntax (the existing-API alternative
    to filelist exposure that staff suggested in the 2026-05-10 forum
    exchange). These passes appear with `pass_kind: "scoped"` and
    `pass_num` 100+, alongside `scoped_label` / `raw_search_text` /
    `srchIn_override` in the per-pass trace. Scoring + decisions run
    through the same machinery so the trace shows whether the scoped
    operator would have produced a different verdict.
