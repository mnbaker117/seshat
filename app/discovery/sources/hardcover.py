"""
Hardcover.app source — GraphQL-backed metadata provider.

Hardcover is the only source with a real public API (GraphQL at
api.hardcover.app/v1/graphql), so this module skips HTML scraping
entirely and uses two queries per author scan:

  1. SEARCH_QUERY (`query_type: "Book"`) — returns a flat list of
     book IDs. Fired multiple times per author: once for the bare
     author name plus once per owned title in `owned_titles[:25]`.
     The result IDs are unioned and capped at 100.
  2. FIND_BOOKS_BY_IDS — pulls full metadata (book + first edition)
     for the entire ID set in a single round-trip, with English
     editions preferred via the `language.code3` filter.

Two non-obvious things in this module worth knowing about:

  - **Search expansion**: a bare-name query returns at most ~10
    results, dominated by samplers and edge-case omnibuses for
    prolific authors. To find a real Sanderson catalog we have to
    fan out queries against the user's owned titles too. The IDs
    are accumulated across ALL queries; do not early-break when
    one query returns hits.
  - **Namesake disambiguation**: Hardcover often has multiple
    authors who share a name (the "David Burke" problem — three
    distinct people, each with their own book list). The
    `search_author` function tallies each book's
    `contributions[].author.id`, vote-ranks them by owned-title
    overlap, and keeps only the winning ID's books before merging.
    Without this filter, the merge would silently glue another
    person's catalog onto the user's author.

Auth: the API key goes into the `Authorization` header. Users paste
the raw token from hardcover.app; we add the `Bearer ` prefix if it's
not already present.

        """Find an author and walk their full bibliography.

        v2.10.5 redesign: replaces the previous book-search-by-name
        approach with a direct two-phase author-id lookup. Solves the
        bug where Jim Butcher returned 10 graphic novels instead of
        his real 146-book catalog — the old SEARCH_QUERY only
        matched books with the author's name in the TITLE, missing
        every novel whose title is just "Storm Front" etc.

        Phase 1: SEARCH_AUTHOR_QUERY by name → disambiguate to a
        single Hardcover author_id (`_resolve_author_id`).
        Phase 2: AUTHOR_BOOKS_QUERY walks `authors.contributions`
        with pagination → full bibliography
        (`_fetch_all_author_books`).
        Phase 3: existing per-book processing loop extracts series,
        edition, cover, language, release date.

        `owned_titles` is no longer needed for query expansion (the
        new path doesn't paginate by guessing book titles) but stays
        in the signature for source-interface compatibility with the
        BaseSource contract and lookup.py's call sites.

        `owned_series_names` — passed through to the per-book series
        picker so Hardcover candidates that match the user's Calibre
        series names beat deeper sub-series like "The Mistborn Saga:
        The Original Trilogy" when Calibre says "The Mistborn Saga".
