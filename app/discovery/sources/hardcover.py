"""
Hardcover.app source — GraphQL-backed metadata provider.

Hardcover is the only source with a real public API (GraphQL at
api.hardcover.app/v1/graphql), so this module skips HTML scraping
entirely and uses two queries per author scan:

  1. SEARCH_QUERY (`query_type: "Book"`) — returns a flat list of
     book IDs. Fired multiple times per author: once for the bare
     author name plus once per owned title in `owned_titles[:25]`.
     The result IDs are unioned and capped at 100.
  2. FIND_BOOKS_BY_IDS — pulls full metadata (book + first edition)
     for the entire ID set in a single round-trip, with English
     editions preferred via the `language.code3` filter.

Two non-obvious things in this module worth knowing about:

  - **Search expansion**: a bare-name query returns at most ~10
    results, dominated by samplers and edge-case omnibuses for
    prolific authors. To find a real Sanderson catalog we have to
    fan out queries against the user's owned titles too. The IDs
    are accumulated across ALL queries; do not early-break when
    one query returns hits.
  - **Namesake disambiguation**: Hardcover often has multiple
    authors who share a name (the "David Burke" problem — three
    distinct people, each with their own book list). The
    `search_author` function tallies each book's
    `contributions[].author.id`, vote-ranks them by owned-title
    overlap, and keeps only the winning ID's books before merging.
    Without this filter, the merge would silently glue another
    person's catalog onto the user's author.

Auth: the API key goes into the `Authorization` header. Users paste
the raw token from hardcover.app; we add the `Bearer ` prefix if it's
not already present.

        Hardcover's `search_author` already returns a fully-populated
        AuthorResult (books + series + metadata) in one GraphQL
        round-trip, so lookup.py's two-phase
        search_author → get_author_books flow collapses into phase 1.
        `_try_source` takes the fast path whenever the search result
        already carries books or series, which is always true for
        Hardcover.

        This stub exists to satisfy the BaseSource contract.
        Returning None degrades gracefully on the unreachable slow
        path: the caller logs "No books returned" and moves on.
        `**kw` swallows lookup.py's extra kwargs so the TypeError-
        fallback in `_try_source` never fires for Hardcover.
