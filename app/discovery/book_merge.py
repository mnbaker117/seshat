"""
Shared books-row merge logic — folds two rows representing the same
work into one, with an audit row.

Used by:
  - `calibre_sync.py`'s post-UPDATE sweep, which heals
    title-mismatch duplicates left over from a previous sync after
    the user fixes Calibre metadata.
  - The manual-merge HTTP endpoint, which lets a user resolve a
    duplicate by searching the library and clicking Merge.

Both paths converge on `merge_books()` so field resolution, FK
redirect, and audit row format stay consistent. The two callers
differ only in how they decide which row is the winner — the sweep
always passes the calibre row as winner; the HTTP endpoint computes
the winner from the two row states (see `_pick_winner`).

    `discovery_db` is the per-library books DB; `pipeline_db` is the
    global seshat.db (where `book_grab_links` lives). Both must be
    passed in by the caller and are NOT closed here — callers manage
    their own connection lifecycle.

    `library_slug` is the slug the discovery_db was opened with. The
    `book_grab_links` redirect is scoped to (slug, book_id) per the
    multi-library safety rule.

    `reason` is a short tag stored in the audit row — typically
    `"calibre_sync_post_update"` for the sweep or `"manual"` for the
    HTTP endpoint.

    Returns the post-merge winner row as a dict. Raises `MergeError`
    on any precondition violation (same id, missing row, two
    calibre+owned rows, etc.). On error the discovery_db transaction
    is rolled back via aiosqlite's exception handling — callers
    should not see partial state.

    Field resolution rules:
      - `owned` → max of both (1 if either)
      - `source` → 'calibre' if either is calibre, else winner's
      - `calibre_id` → coalesce(winner, loser)  — for the sweep this
        always picks the calibre row's id since the loser has NULL
      - `hidden` → MIN(both)  — visible wins
      - `is_new` → MIN(both)  — false wins (once dismissed, stays)
      - `mam_has_multiple` → MAX(both)
      - `mam_my_snatched` → MAX(both)
      - `is_unreleased` → MIN(both)  — released wins
      - `is_omnibus` → MAX(both)  — flag survives
      - `mam_is_bundle` → MAX(both)
      - identity fields (see `_IDENTITY_FIELDS`) → coalesce(winner, loser)
      - metadata fields (see `_METADATA_FIELDS`) → coalesce(winner, loser)
      - `field_source_map`, `user_edited_fields`,
        `metadata_source_pref` → winner's preserved (per-book user
        intent stays anchored to the surviving row)
      - `first_seen_at`, `created_at` → MIN(both)  — oldest preserved
      - `mam_last_scanned_at` → MAX(both)  — most recent scan
        timestamp survives
      - `title`, `author_id` → winner's (the merge is asserting "this
        is the same book", so the winner's identity is canonical)
