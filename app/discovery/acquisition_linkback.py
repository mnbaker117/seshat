v2.3.7 — acquisition link-back.

When Seshat downloads a book through the IRC pipeline (tentative or
auto-approve), the originating MAM torrent_id is recorded in the
global `grabs` table. Once the file lands in Calibre/ABS and the
discovery sync creates a per-library `books` row, that row arrives
with `mam_status=NULL` — the discovery sync has no awareness of the
grabs table, so the link is broken.

Without this module, the next MAM scan tick runs `check_book` (a
fuzzy title+author search) on the new row. For IRC-acquired
audiobooks specifically, the cleaned ABS title diverges from the
MAM torrent name often enough that `check_book` mis-grades many of
them as `not_found` or low-confidence `possible` — even though we
acquired the book from MAM with the exact torrent_id in hand.

`link_new_book` looks up recent unlinked grabs in the global app DB,
matches by normalized title + author, and writes the known
`mam_url` / `mam_status='found'` / `mam_torrent_id` directly to the
discovery row. Conservative match rules (substring on normalized
fields + audiobook/ebook category gate) — false positives are bad
(wrong MAM URL on the wrong book), false negatives just fall back
to the legacy MAM-scan path.
