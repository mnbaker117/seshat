"""
Source-lookup engine.

Iterates the user's authors against external book catalogs (Goodreads,
Hardcover, Kobo, in that priority order) and merges what each source
returns into the local DB. The merge layer is the heart of this module:
it has to reconcile conflicting metadata between sources without
clobbering the user's Calibre-sourced library, and it has to do that
hundreds of times per scan without producing false-positive book matches
or duplicate series rows.

Three things to know before reading:

  1. Title matching is *relaxed* by design — sources spell, capitalize,
     and subtitle-decorate the same book in incompatible ways. The
     `_fuzzy_match` function in this file is the single source of truth
     for "are these the same book?" and is heavily commented because
     small changes silently mis-link books across the entire library.

  2. The merge layer protects Calibre-sourced rows with field-level
     rules instead of a blanket lock — see `_update_existing`. The user
     curates Calibre, so source scans are allowed to enrich it (fill
     missing fields, correct edition-specific dates) but never to
     overwrite curated content.

  3. Series rows are upserted lazily: if a per-source series ends up
     with no linked books in this author after filtering, no series row
     is created. This prevents orphaned series rows from leaking into
     the DB during library-only scans.

              is_unreleased    : LOCKED (almost always False for owned books)

              source_url       : merged into JSON dict (additive, never destructive)
              {source}_id      : COALESCE-fill

            DESCRIPTION (smart stub-detection):
              Calibre imports of older books often have "stub" descriptions —
              one-sentence blurbs from a metadata source that didn't have a
              good summary at the time. The rule is:
                - If existing is null/empty → fill from source.
                - If existing is < 10 words AND new is at least 3x longer
                  in word count → overwrite (the source has a real summary).
                - Otherwise → leave existing alone.
              Threshold is conservative on purpose: a 9-word Calibre stub
              upgrading to a 27-word source description is a clear win;
              we don't want to thrash a 9-word user-curated description
              into a 12-word source description because that's not a real
              improvement.

            PUB_DATE (oldest wins):
              Calibre often has edition-specific dates (a 2015 paperback
              reprint of a 1965 novel). Source scans should be allowed to
              correct that DOWNWARD to the original publication date, but
              never UPWARD (a more-recent edition shouldn't displace the
              original). Rule: if the source's pub_date is strictly older
              (lexicographic compare on ISO YYYY-MM-DD strings, which works
              correctly for dates) than the existing pub_date, overwrite.
              Iterates correctly across multiple sources because each one
              compares against the current value.

            For unowned/missing/discovered books (`source != 'calibre'`),
            none of this applies — the source IS the authority for those
            rows, so the existing full-overwrite behavior continues.

    """Full re-scan: visit every book page to refresh metadata.

    Differs from `run_full_lookup` in two ways:
      - Ignores the cache window — every author is rescanned regardless
        of when they were last looked up.
      - Passes `full_scan=True` down to `lookup_author`, which forces
        the per-source DETAIL fetches to actually re-visit pages
        instead of skipping known-already-cached books. This is the
        only way to refresh stale metadata (descriptions, page counts,
        edition dates) from the source side.

    Slow and expensive. Surfaced via the Dashboard "Full Re-Scan"
    button so it's always an explicit user choice, never automatic.
