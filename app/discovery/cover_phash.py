"""Per-library cover_phash management — backfill + lazy compute.

Sits between the per-library `books` table (where `cover_phash` lives)
and the pure pHash helpers in `app/mam/cover_hash.py`. Handles the
three cover sources Seshat supports:

  - `cover_path` (Calibre-style local file)        → hash from disk
  - `audiobookshelf_id` (ABS-served cover)         → fetch + hash
  - `cover_url` (source-scan external URL)         → fetch + hash

Eager backfill runs on startup ONLY for the cover_path path because
file I/O is cheap and the owned-Calibre case is the largest slice of
the library. Remote-fetch sources (ABS / cover_url) populate lazily
via `ensure_cover_phash` at MAM-scan time so we don't hammer external
hosts on every container restart.
