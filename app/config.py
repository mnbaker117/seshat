Configuration loading and persistence.

Two layers of config:

  1. **Environment variables** (read once at import time): things the
     deployment owner sets via `docker run -e ...`. These seed
     `settings.json` on first run only — after that, settings.json is
     the source of truth and env vars are ignored.
  2. **Saved settings** (`settings.json` under DATA_DIR): runtime-mutable
     state edited via the Settings UI. `load_settings()` always merges
     the on-disk file over `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, so every key listed in
     DEFAULT_SETTINGS is guaranteed to be present in the returned dict.

INVARIANT for adding a new setting:
  1. Add it to DEFAULT_SETTINGS first with its canonical default value.
  2. Any inline `.get("key", FALLBACK)` calls scattered across the code
     MUST use the same FALLBACK as the entry here. Mismatched defaults
     silently diverge for users whose settings.json predates the key.

    v2.9.0 migration: `accept_audiobook_announces` boolean → membership
    of "audiobooks" in `allowed_formats`. The legacy flag did two

      1. Merged `allowed_audiobook_categories` into runtime categories.

    (see `_build_filter_config` in app/main.py). Step (2) is folded
    into the saved `allowed_formats` directly so the UI shows the
    user's true acceptance set without runtime mutation.

    Migration rule:
      * accept_audiobook_announces was True AND allowed_formats was
        non-empty AND "audiobooks" not in it → add it.
      * accept_audiobook_announces was True AND allowed_formats was
