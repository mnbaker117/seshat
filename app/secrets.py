"""
Secret store for Seshat.

Credentials (MAM cookie, qBit password, IRC password, API keys) live
in the `seshat_auth.db` SQLite file alongside the auth_users table.
They're stored as encrypted-at-rest via Fernet symmetric encryption
using the auth_secret as the key material.

This module provides get/set/list operations. The rest of the app
reads credentials through `get_secret(key)` instead of
`settings.get(key)`. The Settings page PATCH endpoint refuses writes
to secret keys; only the dedicated Credentials page routes through
here.

Why not just settings.json?
  - settings.json is a plain JSON file readable by anyone with
    container access. A user backing up their appdata or sharing a
    docker-compose snippet would leak credentials.
  - The auth DB is already 0600-permissioned and logically separate.
  - Fernet encryption means even a DB dump doesn't leak the raw
    values without the auth_secret.

The Fernet key is derived from the auth_secret (which is already
persisted securely — see auth_secret.py).
