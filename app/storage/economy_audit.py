"""
CRUD for the `economy_audit` table.

Every economy-engine path writes exactly one row here, including skips:

  - VIP / upload auto-buy loops (scheduled trigger) — one row per tick,
    even when the decision was "skip_disabled" / "skip_below_interval" /
    "skip_no_trigger". Skips are load-bearing because the UI's
    "Auto-buy history" answers "why didn't the loop fire last tick?"
    from exactly this table.
  - Manual "Buy now" button — one row with `trigger='manual'`.
  - Personal-freeleech buy attached to a grab (F4) — one row with
    `action='personal_fl'` and `torrent_id` set.
  - Buffer-gate skip — one row with `action='buffer_gate_block'`,
    `outcome='buffer_gate_block'`, and `trigger` set to `irc_autograb`
    or `user_grab` so the UI can distinguish automatic blocks from
    manual-inject blocks.

The module is intentionally thin: the callers (scheduler, router,
dispatcher) compose the field values from their own context. This
module only persists them and reads them back. Keeping it dumb means
the decision logic in `app/mam/economy.py` stays pure and the audit
columns stay easy to reason about.
