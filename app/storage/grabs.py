"""
CRUD for the `grabs` and `announces` tables.

Every dispatcher decision produces an `announces` audit row, and
every "yes, fetch this" decision produces a `grabs` row that tracks
state through the pipeline (fetched → submitted → completed / failed).

State machine for `grabs.state`:

    pending_queue → fetched → submitted → downloading → complete
                                       ↘ failed
                       ↘ failed_cookie_expired
                       ↘ failed_torrent_gone
                       ↘ failed_qbit_rejected
                       ↘ failed_unknown

The dispatcher writes the initial state at insert time; later
phases (the qBit poller, the post-download stages) update it as
the torrent moves through the rest of the pipeline.
