"""
Seshat FastAPI entrypoint.

Phase 1 wires:
  - The dispatcher singleton (built once at startup from settings)
  - The manual-inject endpoint
  - The MAM IRC listener (auto-starts on boot, supervised + restarts
    on crash, reconnects with exponential backoff on disconnect)
  - The snatch budget watcher loop (polls qBit, reconciles ledger,
    drains pending_queue when budget frees)

If settings change at runtime (via the eventual Settings UI in
Phase 3), the dispatcher will need to be rebuilt — that plumbing
lives where the Settings UI does, not here.

Both background loops are wrapped in `state.supervised_task` so
they restart automatically on unexpected crashes and a fatal
exception in one doesn't take down the other.
