"""
The filter gate.

`evaluate_announce(announce, config)` is the single decision function
that everything else in Seshat consults to decide whether to grab a
book. It's a pure function over plain dataclasses — no I/O, no
side effects — so it's trivial to unit-test against fixture data and
trivial to call from any pipeline (the IRC listener, the manual-grab
endpoint, the dry-run replay, the test harness).

Decision matrix (faithful port of `previous-stuff/ebook_gate.sh`,
extended with format, language, and category-exclude gates):

    1. Format gate (prefix before " - " in category):
       a. If allowed_formats non-empty and format not in it → SKIP, reason=format_not_allowed
       b. If format in excluded_formats                     → SKIP, reason=format_excluded
    2. If allowed_languages non-empty and language not in it → SKIP, reason=language_not_allowed
    3. If allowed_categories non-empty and cat not in it     → SKIP, reason=category_not_allowed
    4. If category in excluded_categories                    → SKIP, reason=category_excluded
    5. If no author can be detected                          → SKIP, reason=author_not_detected
    6. Walk every parsed author:
       a. If ANY author is on the allow list  → ALLOW, reason=allowed_author
          (allow wins over ignore — if a co-author is allowed, the
          whole release is allowed)
       b. Else if author is on the ignore list → mark as ignored, keep walking
       c. Else                                  → mark as unknown, add to
                                                  weekly-skip set, keep walking
    7. After the walk:
       a. If any author was unknown            → SKIP, reason=author_not_allowlisted
       b. Else if any author was ignored       → SKIP, reason=ignored_author
       c. Else (shouldn't happen — defensive)  → SKIP, reason=author_not_allowlisted_fallback

The original shell script also writes to a CSV skip log and a debug log
file. Those side effects are deliberately NOT in this module — the
caller (the IRC listener / batch processor / test harness) is
responsible for persisting decisions to the `announces` table and
updating the `authors_weekly_skip` table.
