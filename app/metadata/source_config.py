"""
Unified metadata source configuration.

Seshat's metadata / discovery sources were configured across many
scattered settings: `goodreads_enabled`, `rate_goodreads`,
`metadata_provider_priority`, `metadata_audiobook_priority`, and
friends. Phase 7 consolidates them into two keys:

    settings["metadata_sources"] = {
        "goodreads":   {"rate_limit": 2.0,
                        "ebook_enrich": True,  "ebook_scan": True,
                        "audiobook_enrich": False, "audiobook_scan": False},
        "audible":     {"rate_limit": 0.5,
                        "ebook_enrich": False, "ebook_scan": False,
                        "audiobook_enrich": True,  "audiobook_scan": True},
        ...
    }

    settings["metadata_priority"] = {
        "ebook":     ["mam", "goodreads", "hardcover", ...],
        "audiobook": ["mam", "audible", "hardcover", ...],
    }

The ORDER in `metadata_priority[content_type]` defines rank. The
toggles in `metadata_sources[name]` decide which sources run for
which surface (enrich vs scan). Enrich and scan share the same
priority order per content type, but can opt in/out independently.

This module exposes:

* `migrate_legacy_settings(settings)` — one-shot pure function that
  returns a NEW settings dict populated from the legacy keys. Safe
  to call repeatedly; returns early when both new keys already have
  content (idempotent).
* `derive_enrich_priority(settings, audiobook)` — live derivation
  consumed by `_build_metadata_enricher` in main.py.
* `derive_scan_priority(settings, content_type)` — same shape for
  the discovery-side author / library scanners.
* `sync_legacy_keys(settings)` — dual-write helper used by the
  /v1/metadata-sources PATCH path so old code still reading
  `goodreads_enabled` / `rate_goodreads` / `metadata_provider_priority`
  sees consistent values.

Every function is a pure transform over a settings dict — no I/O,
no globals — so unit tests can exercise the edge cases without
touching the real config file.

# All sources the app knows about. The migration seeds an entry for
# each of these (even if the legacy config didn't list them) so the
# new UI always shows every supported source. `available_for`
# describes where a source can run — e.g. Audible only makes sense
# for audiobook content, so its ebook toggles stay hidden/disabled
# in the UI.
#
# Audnexus is deliberately NOT listed here even though the
# `AudnexusSource` class still exists. It has no title/author search
# endpoint, so as a standalone toggleable source it would always log
# "no match". AudibleSource instantiates its own AudnexusSource
# internally to hydrate Audible catalog hits, and the pipeline calls
# `fetch_by_asin()` directly for m4b ASIN lookups — enabling/
# disabling Audible is already the user-facing control for the
# whole Audible+Audnexus chain.

       `metadata_sources` dict. Without this pass, sources added in
