"""
MetaRecord — the common shape every metadata source returns.

Intentionally richer than `BookMetadata` (which comes from the embedded
epub OPF block). Sources populate as many fields as they can; the
enricher merges across sources with first-win semantics on conflicts
and fills nulls from lower-priority sources.

Notes on field semantics:
  - `authors` is a list because multi-author books are common and
    losing co-authors matters for auto-train
  - `confidence` is the title+author similarity score the enricher
    assigned to THIS source's match; used to decide whether to
    accept, fall back to the next source, or tag for manual review
  - `source` is the source name (e.g. "goodreads") so the review UI
    can show which provider each field came from — especially
    important when we eventually let the user edit per-field
  - `cover_url` is the URL the source returned; the cover fetcher
    downloads it separately and stores a path in the review queue
