"""
Similarity scoring for metadata matches.

When a source returns a book, we need to decide: is THIS what we were
searching for, or a different book that happened to share some words?
The enricher calls `score_match()` with the search criteria and the
returned record; the score is used to accept, reject, or fall through
to the next source.

Three title-matching signals combined:

  - **Jaccard overlap** — token intersection / union over normalized
    title words. Good at catching same-words-different-order.
  - **Containment** — fraction of search tokens found in the result.
    Scores high when the result is a superset of the search (e.g.
    "The Triangulum Fold" inside "The Triangulum Fold: The Fold
    Series Book 8"). Pure Jaccard punishes this case; containment
    rewards it.
  - **Substring bonus** — if the search title appears verbatim in the
    result (case-insensitive), apply a floor of 0.85. This catches
    cases like exact title + series decoration.

Author overlap: normalize both sides, check set intersection.

Final confidence is a weighted blend of the best title signal (max of
Jaccard and containment) with author overlap.
