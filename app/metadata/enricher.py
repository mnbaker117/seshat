"""
Metadata enricher — orchestrates scraper sources and merges results.

Called from the pipeline's prepare-book phase with the announce title
+ author blob. Walks the configured source priority list, calling
`search_book` on each until we either:
  - find a source whose result scores above the accept threshold
    (we stop there and return it), OR
  - exhaust the list and return whatever we gathered

Merge semantics across multiple sources:
  - First non-None value wins for each field (the highest-priority
    source that had data for a given field takes precedence)
  - Confidence becomes the MAX confidence seen across all sources
    (a strong match from any source is enough)
  - Cover URL is preferred from the highest-confidence source so we
    don't accidentally pick Goodreads' tiny thumbnail over Amazon's
    full-size cover

Per-source timeout + fail-safe: a stuck scraper never blocks the
pipeline. Each `search_book` is wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for()` with
the configured timeout (default 15s). Exceptions and timeouts are
logged and treated as "this source returned nothing" — the loop
advances to the next provider.

Feature flag: the pipeline only invokes the enricher when
`metadata_enrichment_enabled` is True in settings. Default is
False so existing deployments don't suddenly start making outbound
HTTP calls to every scraper on every book.
