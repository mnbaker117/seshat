"""
Ethical goodreads_book_id resolver chain.

Goodreads' `/search` endpoint is explicitly disallowed for `*`
user-agents per https://www.goodreads.com/robots.txt. We don't hit
it. When the enricher (or any caller) needs a goodreads_book_id for
a book it doesn't already have one for, this module runs a chain of
robots-clean lookups in priority order:

    1. /book/auto_complete?format=json&q={isbn_or_asin}
       — undocumented JSON endpoint, NOT in the Disallow list.
       Identifier-based, not free-text. Handles most ebook imports
       since almost every epub/azw3 carries ISBN in file metadata.

    2. Hardcover GraphQL `book_mappings` — purpose-built for goodreads
       cross-references. One GraphQL roundtrip joins editions →
       book → book_mappings to pull the Goodreads ID without ever
       touching Goodreads itself. Requires a Hardcover API key.

    3. Open Library `?bibkeys=ISBN:{isbn}&jscmd=data&format=json`
       — returns `identifiers.goodreads` for some records. Free,
       no key required. Coverage is sparse (data-quality dependent)
       but it's a useful gap-filler for older / well-cataloged
       books.

    4. /book/auto_complete?format=json&q={title} (v2.13.2) — same
       endpoint as tier 1, but free-text title search. Goodreads'
       internal autocomplete returns up to 5 ranked book results
       with `bookId`, `workId`, and `author.id`. We post-filter
       results by the caller-supplied `author_goodreads_id` so an
       unrelated book that happens to share a title (boxed sets,
       parodies, same-name novels) cannot be picked. When the
       caller has no author_goodreads_id, this tier returns None
       — unconstrained title matches are too risky.

    5. /author/list/{author_goodreads_id} bibliography walk
       (v2.13.2) — page-by-page, schema.org/Book microdata extract,
       fuzzy title-match against the caller's title. Cached in the
       `author_bib` scope of `id_cache` (7-day TTL) so a Sanderson
       lookup pays the page walk once, not per-book. Implemented in
       `app.metadata.goodreads_bibliography`.

If all five tiers miss, return None — the caller (typically the
Goodreads source) skips and the enricher dispatcher moves to the
next source in the priority chain. We do NOT fall back to the
disallowed `/search` endpoint, even though kiwidude's Calibre
plugin does. Holding a higher standard is a deliberate choice.
