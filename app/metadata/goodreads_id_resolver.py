"""
Ethical goodreads_book_id resolver chain.

Goodreads' `/search` endpoint is explicitly disallowed for `*`
user-agents per https://www.goodreads.com/robots.txt. We don't hit
it. When the enricher (or any caller) needs a goodreads_book_id for
a book it doesn't already have one for, this module runs a chain of
robots-clean lookups in priority order:

    1. /book/auto_complete?format=json&q={isbn_or_asin}
       — undocumented JSON endpoint, NOT in the Disallow list.
       Identifier-based, not free-text. Handles most ebook imports
       since almost every epub/azw3 carries ISBN in file metadata.

    2. Hardcover GraphQL `book_mappings` (DEFERRED to v2.11.0)
       — purpose-built for goodreads cross-references. Requires the
       Hardcover discovery-source client which doesn't exist yet at
       v2.10.4. Returns None for now; the chain falls through to
       tier 3.

    3. Open Library `?bibkeys=ISBN:{isbn}&jscmd=data&format=json`
       — returns `identifiers.goodreads` for some records. Free,
       no key required. Coverage is sparse (data-quality dependent)
       but it's a useful gap-filler for older / well-cataloged
       books.

If all three tiers miss, return None — the caller (typically the
Goodreads source) skips and the enricher dispatcher moves to the
next source in the priority chain. We do NOT fall back to the
disallowed `/search` endpoint, even though kiwidude's Calibre
plugin does. Holding a higher standard is a deliberate choice.

The full strategy is documented in
`memory/project_seshat_metadata_overhaul.md` Phase 1.5.
