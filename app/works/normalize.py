"""
Normalization helpers for cross-library work matching.

Matching works across libraries requires canonicalizing names so small
cosmetic differences (Unicode apostrophes, leading articles, trailing
series markers) don't split a single work into two candidate matches.

We keep this module tiny and dependency-free so the matcher can import
it without dragging in the full discovery stack.

Rules — kept deliberately conservative (false positives hurt more than
false negatives; unlinked books can be linked manually by the user):

  `normalize_author`
    - lowercase, strip
    - collapse whitespace
    - strip suffixes like "Jr.", "Sr.", "PhD" (audio rippers sometimes
      add these inconsistently)

  `normalize_title`
    - lowercase, strip
    - drop leading articles "the/a/an"
    - replace unicode apostrophes with ascii
    - strip parenthetical + bracketed sections ("(Unabridged)",
      "[Audiobook]")
    - drop trailing series markers ("The Way of Kings, Book 1")
    - strip punctuation + collapse whitespace

The pair `(normalized_author, normalized_title)` is the matcher's
equality key. It is NOT stored in the DB — we compute it on each
scan so a normalization tweak (or a Unicode library upgrade) takes
effect without a backfill migration.

    Callers bucket books into connected components via any shared key —
    two books share a bucket if ANY of their keys coincide.

    Why multi-key instead of fuzzy scoring?
      Strict keys stay exact-equality for fast bucketing, and each
      loose variant is explicit (deterministic, auditable) so we can
      trust the matcher's output without a human score review loop.
      Two false-positive vectors we deliberately avoid:

          with "Mistborn: The Hero of Ages" — both lose their

          ("Doctor Who - The Day of the Doctor" ≡ "Doctor Who - The
          Time of the Doctor"). Not done.

      The one variant we DO generate is "strip trailing ` - Subtitle`
      IF the base title has 2+ content words" — covers the common
      "Halo: Evolutions - Essential Tales of the Halo Universe" vs
      "Halo: Evolutions" case, while the 2-word floor keeps single-
