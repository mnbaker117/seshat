"""
Cross-library work matcher.

Scans the user's library DBs (one per discovered library) and groups
books that share the same normalized (author, title) pair into a
shared `work_id`. Writes the resulting membership rows into
`work_links` in the pipeline DB.

Runs as a post-sync pass from `calibre_sync` / `audiobookshelf_sync`.
The matcher opens each library's DB in turn, reads (author, title,
id) for every non-hidden book, normalizes, buckets by match_key, and
then persists per-bucket:

  * Bucket with 1 member (no cross-library twin) — no link row needed.
    Phase 5 omits "singleton" rows to keep the table compact; a later
    phase may add them for manual-link lookups.
  * Bucket with 2+ members — if any already has a `work_links` row,
    reuse that work_id; otherwise mint a new one. Insert membership
    rows for the rest (auto only — never stomp a manual link).

Manual links (`link_source='manual'`) are respected: the matcher will
not re-home a manually-linked row, even if its bucket peer has a
different auto-assigned work_id. The frontend's "unlink" button is
the only way to undo a manual link.
