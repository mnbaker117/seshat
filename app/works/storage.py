"""
Work-links storage — CRUD helpers for the cross-library link table.

The caller either passes an open DB connection (test path) or lets the
helper open a fresh one (production path). Writes are always followed
by a commit on helper-opened connections; injected connections are
left for the caller to commit/close.

Why stringy `library_slug` + `book_id` instead of a foreign key?
The linked rows live in per-library discovery DBs (`seshat_{slug}.db`),
not in `seshat.db`. SQLite can't FK across files. The `reconcile`
helper handles orphan cleanup by scanning link rows against the
live per-library DBs during sync.
