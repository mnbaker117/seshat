"""
HTTP-level tests for the v2.14.x Database Manager rework (#F).

Exercises the new `sort`, `sort_dir`, and numeric-aware `search`
behavior on GET /api/v1/db/table/{name}. Older fields (page,
per_page, plain-text search) are covered implicitly by the round-trip
shape assertions.

Tests run against the `announces` table because it carries the
exact mix we need: INTEGER PK (numeric-search target), several
TEXT columns (text-search target), and a natural insertion order
to verify sort semantics against.
