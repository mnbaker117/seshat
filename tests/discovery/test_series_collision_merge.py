"""
v2.10.2 — `_resolve_position_collision` carries identity fields via merge_books.

Pre-v2.10.2 the helper hard-DELETEd the loser at a series-position
collision. Any identity fields the loser uniquely carried
(mam_torrent_id, goodreads_id, isbn) were lost. The 2026-05-12
diagnostic on Mark's library found 5 unowned discovery rows
(7553, 7552, 7545, 7546, 7671) that vanished via this path without
an audit trail — in their case the calibre side already had the
same mam_torrent_id from `acquisition_linkback` so nothing was
actually lost, but the sharp edge could bite the next case where
the loser has a unique ID. Now the helper routes through
`merge_books` so identity fields coalesce and an audit row
records the merge.
