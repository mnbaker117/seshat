"""
v2.10.0 calibre_sync post-UPDATE merge sweep tests.

The merge sweep heals a specific class of duplicate that the
INSERT-path merge can't catch: when a Calibre row was previously
inserted with a wrong / mismatched title that didn't merge with
the existing discovery row, and the user later fixes the title in
Calibre. The next resync hits the UPDATE path (existing
calibre_id), so the INSERT-path merge query never runs — pre-v2.10
the duplicate stayed forever. The sweep re-runs the same
exact-title-match against unowned rows after every UPDATE and
folds in the single unambiguous match.

This was the exact pattern Mark hit with William D. Arand books
on 2026-05-11/12 — six pairs (Right of Retribution 2, Dungeon
Deposed 2/3, Super Sales 2/3, A Temperamental Enchantress) sat
duplicated even after his Calibre metadata fix until the manual-
merge UI shipped.
