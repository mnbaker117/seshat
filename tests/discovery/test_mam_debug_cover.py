"""debug_check_book cover-surface tests.

Step 5 wired Part C cover signals into the debug-match trace. These
tests pin three properties:

  1. `cover_input` block always present in the trace (even when no
     phash provided), so consumers can rely on its shape.
  2. `cover_check` per-result field appears IFF a phash was provided.
  3. Decision string is overridden to
     "would_promote_via_cover_verification" when cover signal is
     "promote" AND no other promote-via-* signal already fired.

`_mam_search` is monkeypatched to return canned responses so no live
MAM traffic. `_annotate_candidate_covers` is also patched to return
deterministic per-tid signals so the cover-side stays decoupled from
real image hashing.
