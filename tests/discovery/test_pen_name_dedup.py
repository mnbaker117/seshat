"""
Tests for pen-name dedup — the cross-linked-author book-merge gate
in `app.discovery.lookup._merge_result`.

The Incubus Inc. bug: Arand (id=19) has book "Incubus Inc. 3"
stored from a prior sync. When scanning the linked author Darren
(id=49), the discovery pipeline's fuzzy-title match accepts
"Incubus Inc." (series #1) against "Incubus Inc. 3" via
substring-containment, then correctly notices the authors are
linked and SUPPRESSES the insert — but the two are different books
in the same series (#1 vs #3), so the suppression is wrong.
Result: #1 silently dropped.

The fix adds `_series_index_conflicts` as a post-hoc guard on the
fuzzy match. If both sides declare a series_index and the indices
differ, the match is rejected so the insert goes through.
