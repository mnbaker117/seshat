"""
Tests for the v2.16.0 Data Hygiene action (`app.discovery.hygiene`).

Coverage:
  - Job 1 deletes zero-book authors and zero-book series, preserves
    `authors_allowed` by name, and is idempotent on a second pass.
  - Job 2 (Hardcover identifier backfill) early-returns when no API
    key, and COALESCE-fills missing IDs from a stubbed Hardcover
    `book_mappings` response when present.
  - Job 4's identifier-keyed merge pass folds two rows sharing a
    `goodreads_id` into a single row, COALESCE-filling identity
    columns from the loser onto the winner.
  - The chain runs to completion on an empty library and returns a
    zero-stats dict (idempotency on a clean DB).

These tests use the same `merge_dbs`-style fixture as
`test_book_merge.py`: monkeypatch `DATA_DIR` to a tmp_path, init
both the pipeline DB and one per-library discovery DB, and drive
the helpers directly. `state._discovered_libraries` is monkeypatched
per-test so the coordinator finds the test library.
