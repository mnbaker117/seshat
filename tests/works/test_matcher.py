"""
End-to-end tests for the cross-library matcher.

Builds two stub discovery DBs (one "ebook" slug, one "audiobook" slug),
seeds them with books that share or don't share a normalized
(author, title) pair, and runs `rebuild_matches`. Asserts on the
resulting `work_links` rows.

Fixtures monkeypatch `app.config.DATA_DIR` to tmp_path so the per-
library DB files land in isolation, then fully init schemas via
`app.discovery.database.init_db` for each library slug. The pipeline
DB (seshat.db) is handled by the `temp_db` fixture.
